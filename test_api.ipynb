As the government braces for critical discussions with car makers, Transport Secretary Louise Haigh has reaffirmed that these EV targets will not be weakened, despite global challenges affecting vehicle demand.\\n\\n## Industry Pressures and Government Response\\n\\nWith a global slump in car demand, manufacturers have expressed concerns that the stringent mandates could threaten jobs and hinder business operations. Car producers like Nissan and those under Stellantis, which owns brands such as Citroën and Vauxhall, align with the government\\'s long-term climate goals but urge for immediate rule modifications to address current market realities.\\n\\nAccording to the current mandate, electric vehicles must account for 22% of a firm\\'s car sales and 10% of their van sales. Failure to meet these requirements triggers a hefty £15,000 fine per car, surpassing the limit. Despite the flexibility in the current system, which allows companies to purchase credits from firms exceeding their sales targets, many predict falling short. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) projects that only 18% of UK car sales presently comprise EVs.\\n\\n\"Louise Haigh has emphasized that flexibility exists within the mandate, but the key goal is not to dilute the overarching ambition,\" Haigh stated in an interview with LBC Radio. Thus, while some concessions might be considered, fundamental targets remain unchanged.\\n\\n## Calls for Reform and Government Support\\n\\nAs the SMMT and car makers prepare for crunch talks with senior government officials, including the business secretary and the energy minister, they are advocating for changes that will boost the industry\\'s competitiveness in a declining market.\\n\\nKey recommendations from the industry include reducing the penalization for missed targets and advocating for government grants and tax changes to incentivize EV purchases. As the UK strives toward net-zero emissions by 2035 with an overarching ban on new petrol and diesel cars, Nissan and others remain committed to facilitating this transition but insist that policy adjustments are necessary for the times.\\n\\nA Nissan spokesperson noted, \"We are committed to net zero in the UK, but market realities necessitate changes now.”\\n\\n## Economic Implications and Strategic Reviews\\n\\nThe downturn in new car registrations by 20% compared to pre-COVID levels underscores the urgency of addressing market dynamics. Stellantis, for example, is reviewing its strategic operations in the UK as it seeks efficiency amidst evolving requirements.\\n\\nCarlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, has previously labeled the rules as \"terrible,\" hinting that they could potentially scale back the company\\'s UK footprint if not addressed. Future commitments and operations in the UK remain contingent on ongoing discussions and future policy alignment.\\n\\nUnite, a leading labor union, is actively engaging with both government and automotive leaders to find a pathway that aligns with protecting jobs while advancing the EV mandate.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs the UK government remains steadfast in its commitment to EV targets, the upcoming talks with industry leaders will be pivotal in shaping the future landscape of the automotive sector. Striking a balance between ambitious environmental goals and economic viability remains the focal point of these discussions.\\n\\nThe outcome of these crucial negotiations will set the stage for how the country navigates its path towards a more sustainable future while supporting one of its historical industrial strengths.\\n```'"
