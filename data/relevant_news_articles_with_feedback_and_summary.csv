Jaguar to launch three new electric models by 2026 with advanced features How Jaguar is transforming the ownership experience for luxury electric vehicle buyers? Why has Jaguar's rebranding has sparked scepticism on social media? Jaguar aims to redefine luxury EVs and compete with Rolls-Royce and Bentley What to expect from Jaguar’s upcoming brand unveiling at Miami Art Week? Jaguar, the iconic British luxury automaker owned by Tata Motors, is embarking on a bold transformation as it shifts to an all-electric future. With a commitment to reinventing itself, Jaguar has unveiled a new logo and branding that emphasises its dedication to originality, luxury, and modernity. The rebranding includes a new ""Leaper"" cat emblem, updated typography, and dynamic marketing slogans designed to resonate with a younger, wealthier audience. As the company prepares to launch three new electric vehicles by 2026, Jaguar aims to redefine the luxury EV market, positioning itself alongside top-tier brands like Rolls-Royce and Bentley.As part of its major rebranding initiative, Jaguar introduced a completely redesigned logo and visual identity to reflect the brand's transformation into a luxury electric vehicle maker. The new logo features a distinctive blend of uppercase and lowercase letters, a design choice that Jaguar believes creates visual harmony. This updated typography reflects the company's evolution, aiming to modernise its image while preserving its premium heritage. One key aspect of the rebranding is the emphasis on the British pronunciation of ""Jag-you-are,"" shifting away from the American ""Jag-wahr."" Jaguar believes the latter doesn't capture the sophistication or luxury that the brand embodies.In addition to the new typography, Jaguar also revamped its iconic ""Leaper"" logo—the prancing cat symbol that has been a hallmark of the brand for decades. The updated Leaper is more angular and dynamic, symbolising the company’s forward-looking, modern identity. While it retains the essence of the original, this new version signifies Jaguar's focus on innovation and contemporary luxury, making it more fitting for the brand's electric future while still honouring its legacy of high-end performance and elegance.Jaguar’s marketing slogans—“delete ordinary,” “live vivid,” and “copy nothing”—serve as powerful statements of the brand’s intention to differentiate itself from the competition and establish itself as a leader in originality and creativity. These phrases reflect the company’s desire to move away from traditional, conventional design practices and mass-market strategies, focusing instead on producing truly unique, innovative products. By using these bold slogans, Jaguar is signalling its commitment to breaking away from the status quo and embracing a more forward-thinking approach in the luxury electric vehicle market.The emphasis on “delete ordinary” and “copy nothing” shows Jaguar's rejection of generic, mass-produced designs in favour of one-of-a-kind, meticulously crafted vehicles. The slogan “live vivid” further enhances this vision, encouraging customers to embrace bold, exciting choices that stand out in the automotive world. Together, these slogans not only highlight Jaguar’s shift toward a more distinct and exclusive identity but also target a modern, discerning audience that values uniqueness, innovation, and high-end experiences in both the products they buy and the brands they engage with. The new brand message reflects Jaguar’s ambition to capture the attention of a younger, affluent demographic that seeks originality and luxury.As part of Jaguar's rebranding efforts, the brand has significantly updated its emblem to align with its new identity as a luxury electric vehicle maker. The iconic Jaguar face logo, which has been a staple on the grilles of Jaguar cars for the past two decades, has been replaced with a more modern and minimalist circular badge. This new badge features a stylized “J” and “r,” reflecting a cleaner, contemporary look while still maintaining the brand's luxurious appeal. The brass-coloured letters stand out against a gold-and-white backdrop, emphasising sophistication and refinement.In addition to the updated logo, Jaguar’s new badge design is further enhanced by a bold new colour palette. The introduction of primary colours like red, blue, and yellow is a deliberate choice, intended to convey the brand's emphasis on exuberance, creativity, and originality. These colours are meant to evoke a sense of energy and innovation, reflecting Jaguar’s shift towards a more dynamic, modern, and forward-thinking image. The redesigned badge not only symbolises the brand's transition but also positions Jaguar as a distinctive player in the luxury EV market, differentiating itself from traditional automotive designs with a strong visual identity.Jaguar's rebranding signals a decisive shift from offering mass-market luxury vehicles to positioning itself as an ultra-premium electric vehicle (EV) brand. Recognizing that its past products, though high-quality, struggled to stand out in an increasingly crowded market dominated by competitors like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar is now recalibrating its approach. The company is moving toward producing “spectacular” vehicles that will appeal to a more exclusive, affluent audience. These new EVs are expected to be priced at roughly double the cost of current models, targeting younger, wealthier buyers who value emotional connections with the brand and its design, rather than simply technical specifications. This move reflects Jaguar’s ambition to redefine luxury and innovation, aiming to attract a new generation of customers looking for distinctiveness, quality, and a deeper brand experience.Jaguar has announced that it will launch three new electric models by 2026. These new models will be designed on a new electric platform and will include significant technological advancements. One of the most anticipated features is a claimed range of up to 430 miles per charge, with the ability to add 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes using a Level 3 fast charger. Furthermore, Jaguar’s electric cars will be compatible with Tesla’s Supercharger network, eliminating the need for a separate adapter, which will make long-distance travel more convenient.In terms of design, Jaguar is positioning its upcoming electric vehicles as a departure from the homogeneity currently seen in the electric vehicle market. The company intends to counteract the common ""aerodynamic blob"" design seen in many EVs by creating low-slung, elegant cars with elongated proportions that evoke the luxury sedans of the past. The first vehicle to showcase this design will be a four-door grand tourer, which will be unveiled at Miami Art Week on December 2, 2024.Jaguar's shift to an electric future is also accompanied by a focus on improving the overall brand experience, including the purchasing process and ownership journey. The company plans to streamline the car-buying process through a new digital ecosystem that will allow customers to configure and order their vehicles online. However, in the U.S., customers will still need to complete the purchase in person, reflecting Jaguar's emphasis on providing a luxury experience at every stage of the process.Jaguar also plans to open exclusive brand experience centres in luxury districts in major cities, beginning with Paris. These spaces will not only serve as retail locations but will also provide customers with a premium experience that reflects the values of the brand.While Jaguar’s rebranding has been met with enthusiasm within the company, social media reactions have been more sceptical. Some users questioned the decision to focus so heavily on the brand’s visual identity without showcasing actual cars in the promotional materials. Others criticized the lengthy rebranding process, with one user sarcastically asking, “Is this for fashion?” Jaguar’s official response to such queries has been that the rebranding represents a “declaration of intent” and that the physical manifestation of their new identity will be unveiled soon.Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk chimed in, asking if Jaguar still sold cars, to which the brand’s social media team responded playfully, inviting him to see the new vehicles at the upcoming Miami event. While the rebranding has sparked confusion for some, Jaguar remains confident that this transformation is essential for the brand’s future.Jaguar is positioning itself to compete with the most exclusive luxury brands in the world, such as Rolls-Royce and Bentley. By focusing on the luxury EV market and eliminating lower-tier models, the company aims to appeal to the ultra-high-end consumer. This new direction is a radical departure from the past, and Jaguar hopes to redefine what it means to own a luxury vehicle in the electric age.Jaguar’s rebranding and transition to electric vehicles are still works in progress, but the upcoming unveiling of the first physical manifestation of its new brand identity at Miami Art Week on December 2, 2024, will offer a glimpse into the future of the iconic automaker. The new electric car, along with the revamped brand, aims to solidify Jaguar’s position as a leader in the luxury electric vehicle market.While questions about the technical aspects of Jaguar’s upcoming electric vehicles remain, the new logos, design ethos, and exclusive positioning provide a clearer sense of where the brand is headed.

The company’s giant gigafactory, in the Swedish town of Skellefteå, remains operational for now. But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion. Despite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m. Northvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading. As investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known. However, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.

Anzeige Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck hat sich zur Lage beim schwedischen Batteriehersteller Northvolt vorsichtig optimistisch geäußert. «Natürlich hat Northvolt Probleme», sagte der Grünen-Politiker der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Die bestünden vor allem darin, dass die Stückzahl der produzierten Batterien im schwedischen Werk nicht hoch genug sei. «Aber das sind technisch lösbare Probleme.» Der finanziell angeschlagene schwedische Batteriehersteller hatte am Donnerstag in den USA ein Restrukturierungsverfahren gemäß «Chapter 11» des US-Insolvenzrechts beantragt. «Das Verfahren, das sie jetzt gewählt haben, kann gut ausgehen», sagte Habeck. Viele Firmen hätten sich darüber bereits saniert. Er wisse von Investoren-Interesse und hoffe, dass eine Neuorganisation gelinge. «Wir brauchen eine eigene europäische Batterieproduktion.» Anzeige Mit Blick die geplante Fabrik bei Heide in Schleswig-Holstein sagte Habeck, dort gehe es erstmal weiter. «Wenn sich das Mutterhaus neu aufstellt und die Investoren wieder reingehen, dann ist auch die Perspektive klar gegeben und gesichert.» Die Probleme müssten aber ernst genommen werden.

Car live selling,” said netizen Jayvee Fernandez. “Selling cars like cellphones.” “Soo cuuutee,” said Celle Repato of the yellow VF 3 model that was used for the live selling. “Adorable,” said another netizen, with others asking for the other colors available. It’s this kind of marketing campaign that has made VinFast the best-selling automotive brand in Vietnam after selling over 51,000 EVs this year. Its VF 3 model sold fast via a pre-order campaign considered by marketing analysts to be the “most successful” in Vietnam’s history. PINK.

VinFast VF 3 sells for P645,000. It’s not the cheapest car of its size in the whole market of small cars (including internal combustion engines or ICE cars) in the Philippines — Toyota’s Wigo and Suzuki’s Dzire, for instance, retail for P609,000 — but the chance of getting a car that’s exempted from coding in Metro Manila (all EV cars are exempted under existing rules) is a definite edge. Another eye candy similar to VinFast’s VF 3 is Bestune Philippines’ Pony. It claims to be the most affordable mini-EV in the market with a retail price of P588,000. Bestune is a subsidiary brand of China’s First Automotive Works. LITTLE PONY.

Screenshot from 12th PEV Summit’s Facebook page Sales boost Low prices, number-coding exemption, eye-catching colors, and more charging stations are now making green cars more attractive to car buyers in the Philippines — and there are clear signs of a behavioral shift. Total Philippine electrified vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2024 reached 14,178, a 133% increase from the 6,088 in the third quarter of 2023, according to data from the latest earnings report of industry leader Toyota Motors Philippines (TMP) released last week. In 2019 or five years ago, only 214 EV cars were sold in the country. It went up to 378 units in 2020, 843 units in 2021, and 3,091 units in 2022, according to the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry or CREVI. The roadmap sets a 50% EV fleet share in the Philippines by 2040. In the short term (2023 to 2028), the target is to have 2.45 million electric vehicles (cars, tricycles, motorcycles, buses, and public utility vehicles) by 2028. For cars, the targets are 415,000 Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), 69,000 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and 69,000 Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Image from Department of Energy’s Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry, 2022. “Electrified vehicles continue to gain further traction supported by TMP’s wide and diverse model offerings and implementation of EO [Executive Order No.] 62,” said Toyota Motors Philippines’ parent, Ty family-led GT Capital Holdings Corporation, on November 14. EO 62, which took effect last July, expanded import duty exemption (zero tariffs) to all three types of electrified vehicles — BEVs, PHEVs, and HEVs — until 2028. Toyota Motors Philippines dominates the electrified vehicle car market in the Philippines with a market share of over 72% in the third quarter of 2024. Toyota’s HEV sales grew 186% year-on-year, while luxury sister brand Lexus’ electrified vehicle sales grew 69%. Toyota Motors Philippines sold 8,441 HEVs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,944 units in the same period in 2023. Among its HEVs are the Camry, Corolla Altis, Corolla, Cross, Rav4, Yaris Cross, Alphard, and Zenix. It launched its best-selling Toyota Prius in the Philippines in 2009 or 15 years ago. Play Video Toyota’s HEV combines internal combustion engines with its “electronically controlled brake system” or ECB. When brakes are applied, kinetic energy recharges the electric motor’s battery. This hybrid system eliminates the need for plugging in. Charging stations When asked whether the Philippines’ electrified vehicle market has finally taken off, Energy Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said in a public forum on Wednesday, November 20: “The answer is yes. Because if you compare the sales of EV from last year to this year, I think it either doubled or tripled. So, it was slow, but it’s getting there.” She said the tax perks granted to EV cars have contributed to the nascent growth of the industry. It’s not just VinFast that’s seeing the opportunity to make money in the Philippines — so is American tycoon Elon Musk. His electric vehicle company Tesla opened its first showroom in the Philippines two weeks ago, with its Model 3 and Model Y retailing at P2.109 million and P2.369 million, respectively. Although the electrified vehicle industry in the Philippines is still very much in its infancy, the entry of low-cost electrified vehicles, mainly from China and Vietnam, could lead to a boom in the coming years. Carla Buencamino, head of mobility infra of ACMobility, said on Friday, November 22, that while the Philippines’ EV industry is still in its nascent stages, it is growing. ACMobility has partnered with BYD, the global leader in EV, in selling BYD EVs in the Philippines. She told ABS-CBN News Channel’s Market Edge that ACMobility is committed to setting up more charging stations in the country, which is crucial to getting consumers to adopt EVs. PLUG. More EV charging stations, such as this one in Estancia Mall, Pasig City, will help convince more car buyers to shift to EVs. Photo by Isagani de Castro Jr./Rappler For cars, Buencamino said the DOE roadmap’s target is 7,000 charged points in 2028, from only 700 in October 2024. “There’s a long way to go, but ACMobility is committed to building this infrastructure,” she said. Similarly, Edmund Araga, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippine, said in October at the 12th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit that the Philippines still has “a long way to go to achieving the industry goal of selling 2.5 million EVs and opening up to [over] 65,000 EV charging stations nationwide by 2028.” He has welcomed, however, the high interest of Filipinos in shifting to EVs. A market research in 2018 by Frost and Sullivan showed 46% of Filipino consumers are open to buying an EV as their next vehicle, the highest among six countries in the ASEAN region.

All this is good news to the country given that the Philippines’ transportation sector is the country’s largest source of air pollution and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE, in its roadmap, citing Department of Environment and Natural Resources data, says 74% of air pollutants nationwide come from transport sources such as cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses. In Metro Manila, transport sources account for 83% of nitrogen oxides, which are harmful to the respiratory tract, and 37% of inhalable particulate matter pollutants. – with a report from Iya Gozum/Rappler.com",Business,bing,"The article provides valuable insights into the current state and potential growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market in the Philippines.

Jetzt ist das Unternehmen jedoch zahlungsunfähig. Welche Auswirkungen hat das auf das Bauprojekt? Update vom 22. November, 11:30 Uhr: Nach dem Antrag des finanziell angeschlagenen schwedischen Batterieherstellers Northvolt auf Gläubigerschutz in den USA ist Firmenchef Peter Carlsson zurückgetreten. Er bleibe dem Unternehmen aber als Mitglied des Aufsichtsrates sowie als führender Berater erhalten, teilte Northvolt in Stockholm mit. Carlsson führte Northvolt seit der Firmengründung im Jahr 2016 und zählt zu den Mitgründern des Unternehmens. Peter Carlsson hat seinen Rücktritt als Northvolt-Chef angekündigt. (Archivbild) © Marcus Brandt/dpa Erstmeldung vom 22. November, 8:30 Uhr: Stockholm/Heide – Die Krise in der Automobilindustrie hat Folgen für die ganze Lieferkette. Für Elektroautos bedeutet das unweigerlich die Batterien, bei denen Europa ohnehin schwächer dasteht als die Konkurrenz aus China. Das schwedische Unternehmen Northvolt sollte das ändern und zu Europas wichtigstem Batterieproduzenten wachsen. Dieses Vorhaben erhält nun einen Rückschlag: Die Firma ist insolvent. Northvolt meldet Insolvenz an: Batteriehersteller hat Milliarden-Schulden Der angeschlagene schwedische Batteriehersteller Northvolt hat Gläubigerschutz nach US-Recht beantragt und sucht nun nach einem weiteren Investor. Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag (21. November) mit. Das Sanierungsverfahren nach Kapitel 11 (Chapter 11) des US-Insolvenzrechts schützt Northvolt für eine gewisse Zeit vor dem Zugriff seiner Gläubiger und erleichtert damit den finanziellen Neustart. „Das über allem stehende Ziel ist es, mit einem oder mehreren langfristigen strategischen oder Finanzinvestoren zusammenzuarbeiten“, hieß es in den Gerichtsunterlagen. Zugleich erhält das Unternehmen Zugriff auf 245 Millionen Dollar und kann damit sein Überleben in den kommenden Wochen gewährleisten. Der Schritt, in den USA Gläubigerschutz zu suchen, kommt nicht überraschend: Die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters hatte vergangenen Freitag unter Berufung auf Insider gemeldet, dass Northvolt den Schritt in Betracht ziehe. Northvolt verfügt den Gerichtsunterlagen zufolge derzeit nur noch über flüssige Mittel von 30 Millionen Dollar – das reicht den Angaben nach gerade noch für eine Woche. Zugleich liegt der Schuldenberg inzwischen bei 5,8 Milliarden Dollar. Das Unternehmen hatte in den vergangenen Monaten mit seinen Geldgebern über ein Finanzierungspaket verhandelt, allerdings ohne Erfolg. Insolvenz von schwedischem Batteriehersteller: Volkswagen ist größter Anteilseigner Nun stellt der schwedische Lkw-Hersteller Scania Northvolt ein Darlehen in Höhe von 100 Millionen Dollar zur Verfügung. Damit solle die Herstellung von Batteriezellen für E-Fahrzeuge im nordschwedischen Skelleftea unterstützt werden. Scania bezieht schon jetzt Batterien von Northvolt. Die weiteren 145 Millionen Dollar sind Mittel von Northvolt, die bislang als Sicherheiten zurückgelegt wurden. Der größte Anteilseigner ist Volkswagen, auch die US-Investmentbank Goldman Sachs und BMW gehören zu den Eigentümern. BMW und Goldman Sachs lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab. Volkswagen erklärte am Abend, man stehe mit Northvolt in engem Kontakt. Die vom Northvolt-Mitbegründer Harald Mix geleitete Investmentgruppe Vargas beschrieb den Schritt als notwendig, um die Kapitalstruktur zu stärken. Gleichzeitig könne das Unternehmen den Betrieb aufrechterhalten, sich auf die Steigerung der Fertigungszahlen konzentrieren und die Kosten senken. Man sei überzeugt, dass Northvolt diese Zeit durchstehen werde. Northvolt selbst erklärte, das Unternehmen erwarte, die Restrukturierung bis zum ersten Quartal 2025 abzuschließen. Solange werde der Betrieb wie gehabt weitergehen. BMW zog Mega-Deal mit Northvolt zurück – Northvolt-Insolvenz ist Rückschlag für die Branche Der Batteriehersteller benötigt derzeit dringend Geld und arbeitet seit mehreren Wochen mit seinen Investoren an einem Rettungspaket. Die schwedische Regierung hatte jüngst erklärt, keine Anteile von Northvolt übernehmen zu wollen. Northvolt hat noch nie einen Gewinn erwirtschaftet und kämpft mit Qualitätsproblemen und Verzögerungen. Im Juni zog deswegen BMW einen Auftrag mit einem Volumen von zwei Milliarden Euro zurück. Wegen wegbrechender Aufträge und Problemen beim Hochfahren der Produktion hatte der Konzern zuletzt seine Ausbaupläne massiv eingedampft, tausende Mitarbeiter entlassen und Tochtergesellschaften verkauft. Noch am Mittwoch ernannte Northvolt den Sanierungsexperten Paul O‘Donnell zum Chef seiner Hauptanlage in Nordschweden. Der Antrag auf Gläubigerschutz ist ein Rückschlag für die europäischen Bemühungen, sich mit einer eigenen Batterie-Industrie unabhängiger von chinesischen Herstellern wie CATL und BYD zu machen. Nach Daten der Internationalen Energieagentur ist 85 Prozent der Batteriezellen-Herstellung in der Volksrepublik beheimatet. Northvolt hat zwar eine Reihe von europäischen Startups bei der Investition von Milliardensummen in die Batteriefertigung angeführt. Allerdings ist die Nachfrage nicht so schnell angestiegen wie von Teilen der Branche vorhergesagt. Northvolt baut Fabrik in Deutschland: Bau wird sich wohl verzögern Noch ist nicht abzusehen, was das konkret für den Bau einer Northvolt-Gigafabrik im schleswig-holsteinischen Heide bedeutet. Das Unternehmen erklärte dazu am Abend: Die deutsche Tochter werde unabhängig von der Muttergesellschaft finanziert. „Sie ist nicht Teil des Chapter 11-Verfahrens.“ Deutschlandchef Christofer Haux sagte, „in Dithmarschen schreiten die Bauarbeiten derweil weiter voran. Der Standort genießt höchste Priorität.“ Klar ist aber bereits, die Fabrik soll später ihre Arbeit aufnehmen als zunächst geplant. Die Zellmontage soll erst in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2027 starten, statt bereits Ende 2026. Aber der Zeitplan für die Großbaustelle verzögert sich. (Archivbild) © Christian Charisius/dpa Anfang des Jahres hatte die EU-Kommission Fördermittel und Garantien für das Milliarden-Projekt in Heide über 902 Millionen Euro genehmigt. Der Bund und das Land Schleswig-Holstein unterstützen den Bau der Batteriefabrik mit rund 700 Millionen Euro. Hinzu kommen mögliche Garantien über weitere 202 Millionen Euro. Eine Verwaltungsvereinbarung sieht vor, dass zunächst die Landesmittel in Höhe von 137 Millionen Euro fließen sollen. Das ist bislang aber nicht der Fall gewesen. Auf den Bund entfallen etwa 564 Millionen. Schleswig-Holstein in Sorge um Northvolt: Bauarbeiten in Heide sollen aber weiterlaufen Der Batteriehersteller verwies darauf, dass der Bau in Norddeutschland im gemeinsam mit Bundes- und Landesregierung festgelegten Zeitplan liege. „Es wurden bisher keine Fördermittel in Anspruch genommen, und Northvolt Germany wird, solange die Restrukturierung der Muttergesellschaft andauert, auch weiterhin keine Mittel abrufen.“ Schleswig-Holsteins Staatskanzleichef Dirk Schrödter (CDU) sieht Chancen für einen Restrukturierungsplan gemeinsam mit den Gläubigern. Es sei bedauerlich, dass noch keine gesicherte Finanzierung für den Mutterkonzern in Schweden gelungen sei, sagte Schrödter. „Es ist gut, dass nach den Diskussionen der letzten Wochen jetzt Klarheit über das weitere Verfahren und die nächsten Schritte herrscht.“ „Es ist gut, dass die Bauarbeiten in Heide weiterlaufen und nun konkrete Aussagen zum Zeitplan getroffen wurden“, sagte Schrödter. Das Land werde alle förderrechtlichen Fragen gemeinsam mit dem Bund prüfen. „Fragen betreffend etwaige Risiken für den Bund und das Land werden derzeit eingehend mit dem Bund besprochen und bewertet, über die Risikoposition des Bundes und des Landes hinsichtlich der Wandelanleihe kann somit derzeit noch keine Aussage getroffen werden, da das Verfahren unter Chapter 11 erst beginnt“, erklärte Schrödter.

Das ist im Haus günstiger als eine Gasheizung; und bei Elektroautos entlastet es den Akku. Denn E-Autos beziehen technisch bedingt keine Abwärme vom Verbrennungsmotor, die sich via Wärmetauscher zum Aufwärmen des Innenraums nutzen ließe. Wie spart die Wärmepumpe Energie? Ohne Wärmepumpe muss die konventionelle Heizung vereinfacht gesagt über Heizwiderstände verhältnismäßig viel Strom direkt aus dem Fahrakku ziehen. Der fehlt dann fürs Fahren – insbesondere im Winter, wenn Kälte den Akku schwächt. Im Winter saugen zusätzliche Verbraucher wie Heckscheiben-, Lenkrad- und Sitzheizung, Ventilator sowie Fahrlicht Energie. Die Wärmepumpe holt sich zwar ebenfalls Strom aus dem Fahrakku, aber sie benötigt deutlich weniger als eine elektrische Heizung. Zoom Um ein eiskaltes E-Auto aufzuwärmen, benötigt die Wärmepumpe fast so viel Energie wie konventionelle Heizungen. Besser: Vorwärmen an der Ladesäule. Bild: DPA Wie funktioniert die Wärmepumpe im Elektroauto? Die Funktionsweise einer Wärmepumpe ähnelt der eines Kühlschranks. Mit dem Unterschied, dass das Innere vom Kühlschrank gekühlt, der Innenraum des Elektroautos dagegen erwärmt wird. Allerdings funktioniert eine Wärmepumpe auch umgekehrt: Sie kann bei Sommerhitze das Wageninnere kühlen. Akkuheizung . Umgekehrt kühlt sie im Fahrbetrieb eine erhitzte Batterie und nutzt deren Abwärme ebenfalls für die Beheizung des Innenraums. Generell wird der Außenluft die Wärme (oder eben Kälte) über einen Wärmetauscher entzogen. Er gibt die Temperatur an ein Kältemittel weiter, das in einem Kreislauf kursiert. Ein weiterer Wärmetauscher gibt dann die Kälte bzw. Wärme an die Luft ab, die ein Gebläse in den Innenraum transportiert. So versorgt die Wärmepumpe auch die. Umgekehrt kühlt sie im Fahrbetrieb eine erhitzte Batterie und nutzt deren Abwärme ebenfalls für die Beheizung des Innenraums. Wie viel Akku-Reichweite spart die Wärmepumpe? ""Als Faustformel lässt sich sagen, dass für eine Heizleistung von 2,5 bis 3 Kilowatt eine Pumpenleistung von 1 Kilowatt notwendig ist – das gilt für Luftwärmepumpen in Häusern"", sagt Matthias Vogt vom ADAC. Bleibt also bei der Wärmepumpe eine Ersparnis von ungefähr 1,5 bis 2 kW, die nicht aus dem Akku gezogen werden – und damit für mehr Reichweite zur Verfügung stehen. Geht man davon aus, dass moderne Elektroautos im Alltagsbetrieb um die 20 kWh Strom auf 100 km verbrauchen, kommt man auf eine Ersparnis von rund zehn Prozent. Bei einer Akku-Reichweite von 300 km ergäbe sich ein Reichweiten-Plus von ungefähr 30 km. Rein rechnerisch natürlich, denn in der Praxis erschweren viele Unbekannte die Berechnung. Kia zum Beispiel gibt beim EV6 den Reichweiten-Zugewinn mit etwa 50 km an. Wann arbeitet die Wärmepumpe am effizientesten? Matthias Vogt: ""Es gibt so viele Faktoren, die die Effizienz beeinflussen, dass der Nutzen der Wärmepumpe allein schwierig zu beurteilen ist."" So habe jedes Elektroauto-Modell einen anderen Effizienzgrad. Und je nach Außentemperatur arbeite die Wärmepumpe mal mehr, mal weniger effizient. ""Je niedriger die Temperatur, desto schwieriger für die Wärmepumpe"", sagt Matthias Vogt. Er fügt hinzu: ""Bei wirklichen Minusgraden ist kein signifikanter Vorteil der Wärmepumpe feststellbar."" Dann wird ihre Ausbeute einfach zu gering. Zoom Stefan Moeller von Nextmove testete einen Kia e-Niro mit Wärmepumpe: Er übernachtete bei Minusgraden im Auto, um die Akku-Kapazität zu testen. Bild: nextmove.de Ein weiterer Aspekt, den Käufer von Elektroautos kennen sollten: ""In der Aufheizphase kann die Wärmepumpe ihre Stärken noch nicht ausspielen, da hier immer eine hohe Heizleistung erforderlich ist"", sagt Stefan Moeller von Nextmove, Deutschlands größtem Elektroauto-Vermieter. Mit anderen Worten: Nach einer eisigen Winternacht braucht die Wärmepumpe zum Aufwärmen des Innenraums fast genauso viel Strom wie die elektrische Heizung. Moeller testete im Winter die Heizleistung eines Kia e-Niro mit Wärmepumpe, indem er bei Minusgraden darin übernachtete Was ist auf der Kurzstrecke besser als die Wärmepumpe? Moeller: ""Wir beobachten beim Kaltstart je nach Modell Heizleistungen von 4 bis 9 kW. Im Kurzstreckenbetrieb bringt eine Wärmepumpe also nicht viel."" Nach seiner Erfahrung sind für die Kurzstrecke Lenkrad- und Sitzheizung mindestens ebenso gut geeignet – aber viel günstiger in der Anschaffung. Bei VW ID.3 und Kia EV6 zum Beispiel ist beides bereits im Basismodell Serie. Der Trick: Hier wird die Wärme ""direkt am Körper platziert"", so Moeller. Der Energiebedarf liegt bei unter 100 Watt. Einen weiteren Schritt geht der beheizbare Sicherheitsgurt, den der Zulieferer ZF kürzlich vorstellte. Er ist bis auf 40 Grad aufheizbar und soll bis zu 15 Prozent Energieeinsparung bringen. Vor 2025 ist allerdings nicht mit einer Markteinführung zu rechnen. Bei Fahrtests hat Nextmove mit der Wärmepumpe vor allem auf der Langstrecke akzeptable Resultate gemessen: ""Bei einigen Modellen konnte sie den Verbrauch für die Beheizung auf längeren Fahrten mehr als halbieren"", so Stefan Moeller gegenüber AUTO BILD. Nach seiner Einschätzung liegt die Einsparung insgesamt bei fünf bis zehn Prozent. Für wen lohnt sich die Wärmepumpe, für wen eher nicht? Rechnet man die knapp 1000 Euro Aufpreis in Stromersparnis um, bedeutet es (erneut sehr grob geschätzt): Bei zehn Prozent Stromersparnis wäre die Anschaffung nach etwa 100.000 Kilometern amortisiert, es sei denn, die Wärmepumpe steckt serienmäßig im Auto drin, dann fällt die Berechnung schwer. Diese Kalkulation betrifft nur die reine Investition. Hinzu kommen natürlich der Komfort- und Zeitgewinn. Denn man braucht im Winter weniger Ladestopps und kann weiter fahren. Was sagt der Experte dazu? ""Es kommt darauf an"", ist das diplomatische Fazit von Moeller. Wer in gemäßigten Breiten mit milden Wintern lebt, eine temperierte Garage nutzen kann und nur Kurzstrecke fährt, benötigt demnach keine Wärmepumpe. Für regelmäßigen Langstreckenbetrieb, eiskalte Nächte und Laternenparker dagegen ist sie in jedem Fall attraktiv. Und natürlich für alle, die an einer etwas höheren Reichweite interessiert sind – auch wenn es am Ende nur 15 bis 20 Kilometer sind. Nicht zu vergessen: der höhere Wiederverkaufswert, wenn man das E-Auto als Gebrauchtwagen weiterverkauft. Wie bemerkt man die Arbeit der Wärmepumpe beim Vorheizen? Ein weiterer Unterschied ist hörbar: ""Den Betrieb kann der Kunde durchaus wahrnehmen"", sagt Matthias Vogt vom ADAC. So würde sich eine aktivierte Wärmepumpe beim Vorheizen im Stand durch vernehmliches Brummen und Vibration bemerkbar machen. Man hört die Anlage also arbeiten. Der Geräuschpegel der Auto-Wärmepumpe könne durchaus auf dem Level der stationären Gebäude-Wärmepumpe liegen, so Vogt. Zoom Im Winter haben Akkus weniger Kapazität, außerdem ziehen Verbraucher wie Heckscheibenheizung und Licht mehr Energie. Bild: Toni Bader Auch während der Fahrt bemerke zumindest der Fahrer es, wenn sich die Wärmepumpe einschaltet: Das ist zum Beispiel durch Vibration am Lenkrad erkennbar. Die Geräuschentwicklung ist aber nicht immer gleich. Vogt: ""Das hängt wohl damit zusammen, wie stark die Pumpe arbeiten muss und wie gut die Anlage von der Karosserie entkoppelt ist."" Auf die Fahrdynamik hat der Betrieb der Wärmepumpe keinen Einfluss. Lässt sich die Wärmepumpe im Elektroauto nachrüsten? Bei vielen älteren Elektroautos ist keine Wärmepumpe installiert. Leider lässt sich dieses Bauteil meist nicht nachträglich einbauen, da die Flüssigkeitskreisläufe anders ausgelegt sind. Gebrauchte E-Autos lassen sich also nicht im Nachhinein mit Wärmepumpe (WP) ausstatten. ""Das Heizungssystem unterscheidet sich deutlich von der Variante ohne WP"", so Matthias Vogt vom ADAC.

This technology is akin to a fridge in reverse, capable of both heating in winter and cooling in summer. Although heat pumps offer up to a ten percent increase in range, their efficiency varies with temperature. They perform best in moderate conditions, but at very low temperatures, their efficiency decreases, and the energy savings diminish. On short trips, it might be more effective to use seat and steering wheel heaters, while heat pumps offer significant benefits on long journeys. The financial viability of installing a heat pump depends on driving habits and climate, with a potential payback after substantial mileage. Retrofitting heat pumps in older EV models is generally not feasible due to incompatible heating systems. The resale value of an EV might increase with a factory-installed heat pump, and its operation can be slightly audible and tangible through vibrations. Heat pumps are recommended for those driving long distances or in regions with harsh winters, while they may not be necessary for those in milder climates or primarily taking short trips."

The imposing camouflaged sedan looks to rival the likes of Lamborghini and Maserati, among others. The United Kingdom-based carmaker has released the images. Jaguar shocks the world with fully electric car The Jaguar full electric car edition is yet to be identified as far as its model but some reviewers say it will be called I-type. The full EV car plans to shake the market as it looks to rival top-of-the-range cars such as Maserati and Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini. As imposing and massive as it is, the car is somewhere between a four-door coupe and a shooting brake, there’s no doubt this entirely camouflaged prototype is our first look at Jaguar’s future. Published by the company, the first images of the prototype car were seen undergoing test sessions in England. According to motor1.com, this will be the first in what Jaguar calls its “new species” of high-end vehicles. It will be shown on December 2 in Art Week Miami alongside three additional concept cars as part of the brand’s hard “reset.” Jaguar to transform competition in the EV space The car publication reports that the sedan carmaker is looking to transform from a “premium” brand competing with the likes of Audi and BMW, into a high-end automaker alongside alternatives like Maserati and Porsche. The technology and performance will improve, and the price, as expected, will go up. Initial costs will be somewhere in the $130,000 to $140,000 mark. Arguably even more important, though, will be the brand’s design revolution. The car boasts a substantial presence on the road. “In terms of proportions, it is very far from what we do today. To get there, I divided the design team into three groups. Within three months they produced 17 full-size models with different design languages, some were familiar, others looked like something out of science fiction movies,” reports motor1. “The design language we chose is exuberant. Just think of something that will be different on the road. And in December we will unveil our new design language. “The photos suggest the final product of the car will have a very long nose and an incredibly high beltline. And even though it has a “grille,” this car will be 100% electric—so it’s mostly for show.” Will the new Jaguar be called an I-type? Caranddriver reports that a recent U.S. trademark application indicates that they could be I-type—this makes sense given that Jaguar’s first EV effort was branded I-Place. While that Jaguar SUV model’s production abruptly ended in 2024, and while it made a splash when it debuted, its 240-mile driving range meant it lagged behind newer rivals in recent years. What will the Jaguar I-type offer? Based on speculation from car review gurus and publications, the imposing car will come with unique features. “Whether or not it gets the name I-type, the new model should offer at least 300 miles of driving per charge, and we suspect it will come with two motors and offer all-wheel drive,” writes Drew Dorian. “Jaguar hasn’t commented on the powertrain specs, but we know the car will ride on a new electrical architecture. “Pricing is also unknown, but given Jaguar’s ambitions to move upmarket, we think the I-type will likely require a six-figure outlay.” Even though it’s still camouflaged, Jaguar’s first high-end EV already looks promising. The big question is: Will it compete against the industry’s big guns, only time will tell once the car hits the market.",Uncategorized,bing,"This article provides an insight into Jaguar's entry into the electric vehicle market with a new, high-end model, potentially called the I-type.

Electric vehicle HVAC system: Essential components and functions,"This innovative technology is revolutionizing how we think about heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in cars.",https://www.tirereview.com/electric-vehicle-hvac-system/,,2024-11-22 17:09:00,Tire Review Magazine,,"When it comes to electric vehicles, we can’t ignore the crucial role of the electric vehicle HVAC system. This innovative technology is revolutionizing how we think about heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in cars. We’ve seen a significant shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric ones, and with this change comes a whole new approach to keeping passengers comfortable while maximizing energy efficiency. There’s been a considerable increase in compressor technology for electric vehicle HVAC systems. The heart of these systems is the electric compressor, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cabin comfort and optimizing energy efficiency. Unlike traditional belt-driven compressors, electric compressors offer variable speed control, allowing for precise adjustment based on cooling demands. This flexibility results in improved energy management and reduced power consumption. One of the most promising advancements is scroll compressor technology. These compressors feature two interleaved spiral components – a stationary fixed scroll and a moving scroll that orbits around it. This design has a big impact on efficiency and smooth operation, generating less vibration and noise compared to traditional reciprocating compressors. The compact size and lightweight nature of scroll compressors make them ideal for electric vehicles, where space and weight savings are crucial. There have been significant strides in heating systems for electric vehicles as well. One innovative solution is the heat pump. This system transfers heat from outside the car, reducing battery drain. It’s 2-3 times more efficient than traditional heating methods, even in temperatures approaching -20°F. Heat pumps can help EVs recover 3-15% of range lost in cold weather. The High Voltage Heater (HVH) has emerged as a game-changer. This compact device, offers impressive efficiency. Unlike heat pumps, it uses water heating instead of air heating. The HVH can maintain cabin comfort and preheat the traction engine. It works with a wide range of voltages (100-450V) and delivers up to 7 kW of heating power. These advancements are crucial for addressing the cold-weather range reduction challenge in EVs, especially in cold climates. By optimizing heating efficiency, manufacturers are tackling ‘range anxiety’ and making electric vehicles more practical for everyday use.

Electric shock: carmakers battle strict UK electric car rules as big fines loom,"<div><img src=""https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cd517f82fa9735532b952332c10847e7e27a08/0_187_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=add445af32a5aa7f953f0c6622906aff"" style=""width: 100%;"" /><div>As Ford announced cutting 800 UK jobs it said rules forcing companies to sell more EVs each year are ‘unworkable’</div></div>",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/22/electric-shock-carmakers-battle-strict-uk-electric-car-rules-as-big-fines-loom,,2024-11-22 16:35:32,Jasper Jolly,,"When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said. Someone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year. “Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.” The carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars. During the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery. Demand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable. The carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks. Under the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035. The mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen. For the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway. View image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge The Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate. Yet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require. Vicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said. “We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla). With all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate. Ben Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%. Carmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs. The business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals. Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers. “The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said. Whatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are. David Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",,rss,"The article provides an insightful analysis into the challenges faced by car manufacturers due to the UK's stringent electric vehicle (EV) sales mandates.

The Japanese automaker, which operates Britain's largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don't manufacture in the UK. The move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you'd like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk Nissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate's 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations. Missing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry. Guillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: ""Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. ""The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. ""We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector."" Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an ""urgent need"" to protect the sector.

How Utah's electric vehicle charging prices compare to the rest of the US,"Utah's gas prices are a slightly higher than the national average, but new data shows it has some of the lowest electric vehicle recharging prices.",https://www.ksl.com/article/51195478/how-utahs-electric-vehicle-charging-prices-compare-to-the-rest-of-the-us,,2024-11-22 13:36:00,KSL,,"Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes SALT LAKE CITY — At $3.11 per gallon, Utah's average cost for regular gasoline is one of the more expensive in the U.S. a week before Thanksgiving, about a nickel higher than the national average, according to AAA. However, with an average of about $0.29 per kilowatt-hour, the organization says the Beehive State is home to some of the cheapest electric vehicle prices in the nation right now. AAA announced Thursday that it will now track electric vehicle charging costs as part of its fuel price index in response to a growing demand in the market. ""With nearly 2 million members living in households with one or more electric vehicles, AAA recognizes the need to track the average kilowatt-per-hour cost for all levels of public charging by state,"" officials wrote in a statement. The national average debuted at about $0.35 per kilowatt-hour, making Utah's average roughly a nickel per kilowatt-hour lower than the average. Only Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Texas have lower rates in the inaugural report, while Hawaii, West Virginia, Montana, New Hampshire and Arkansas have the highest rates — ranging from $0.42 to $0.57 per kilowatt-hour. The scattered nature is much different from the gasoline prices right now, where the cheapest prices are centered across the lower Midwest and most of the Southeast. The highest gasoline prices are centered across the West and Northeast right now. Additional data shows which states have the most public electric vehicle charging stations. Utah's average is based on a review of the costs at 544 public charging stations scattered across the state, which makes it 21st in terms of available charging stations for anyone to access. There were a little over 37,000 electric vehicles and 76,000 hybrid vehicles registered in Utah this year, according to the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles. The number of electric vehicles alone is nearly seven times higher than what the agency reported five years ago. Meanwhile, the number of public charging stations in U.S. states is fairly close to the country's population leaders, as one would suspect. However, it also indicates which states have jumped onto the electric vehicle trend faster than others. California leads the nation with over 11,300 stations, nearly double any other state. New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas round out the top five. Wyoming and North Dakota are the only states with fewer than 20 public stations, at least at the time of the first report. Alaska, Montana and Louisana round out the bottom five in access. Of course, many more are on the way in Utah and across the West.

Think electric cars are causing UK’s potholes? Here’s what’s really happening,"Blaming EVs for the poor state of the nation’s roads is a ‘myth that desperately needs busting’, say motoring experts",https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/motoring/electric-cars-uk-potholes-what-happening-3390461,,2024-11-22 06:34:00,i,,"Explained Electric car advocates have been forced to fight a series of myths and misconceptions pushed by critics of the technology over the past decade. Despite their rise in popularity, one of the most persistent claims about electric vehicles (EVs) is that they are responsible for Britain’s pothole crisis. Several press stories and columns have suggested that because electric cars are typically heavier than petrol-based equivalents due to their batteries, they must be causing more damage to the roads. But motoring groups and experts told i that the idea is “stupid and ridiculous” – a flawed assumption based on a failure to understand the real causes behind the pothole epidemic. The AA said the belief that electric cars was behind the dire state of the nation’s roads was a “myth that desperately needs busting”. Quentin Wilson, the former Top Gear presenter, is frustrated that the potholes claim is still being circulated online among those sceptical about the rise of EVs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves promised an extra £500m for road repairs at last month’s Budget (Photo: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) “It’s a myth that has had real traction, sadly, when it’s demonstrably not true,” said the broadcaster, founder of the FairCharge campaign to make EVs more accessible. He points to a 2022 University of Edinburgh study, which he claims shows that the extra damage would be “overwhelmingly caused by large vehicles – buses, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs)” if batteries replaced fossil fuels. Passenger vehicles of all kinds make only a “negligible contribution”, according to the study. Wilson said: “It shows that damage to roads by passenger cars is miniscule compared to the damage by tankers, bin lorries and so on.” He added: “We have 1.2 million electric cars on our roads, compared to 41 million combustion engine vehicles. So how could electric cars cause the pothole crisis we have? EVs are a distraction from talking about how we fix the problem.” Robert Llewellyn, presenter of the Fully Charged YouTube channel on EVs, said blaming electric cars was “ridiculous”. The broadcaster added: “All vehicles enhance potholes in some way, and the HGVs will contribute most. But it’s as stupid blaming electric cars as blaming SUVs or any particular kind of car – it’s a bias based on nothing.” The Brussels-based sustainable transport group, Transport and Environment, says electric cars are 300kg to 400kg heavier than petrol and diesel equivalents on average. However, an October study by the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), which looked at the top ten best-selling electric and fossil-fuelled cars in Australia, found that the battery-powered vehicles were only 68kg heavier. Llewellyn said manufacturers were finding ways to shed weight from EVs. “Yes, electric cars have been generally heavier, but only by the weight of a person. And it won’t be true for much longer. Some electric cars are now lighter than their petrol equivalent.” Earlier this year the Daily Mail corrected an article which claimed that electric cars were helping push Britain’s crumbling roads to breaking point. It had suggested that a report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) had pointed the finger at EVs and their heavy, lithium-ion batteries. In fact, the AIA’s March 2024 report had only referred to “increased average vehicle weights on a deteriorating network”, without specifying any particular kind of vehicle. The real thrust of report had been about the lack of funding to repair potholes and upgrade roads – blaming lack of Government investment for the “continued deterioration”. Chancellor Rachel Reeves promised an extra £500m for road repairs at last month’s Budget. But AIA’s 2024 report found that many years of cuts to council budgets meant the amount needed to fix the backlog of road repairs in England and Wales has risen to a record high of £16.3bn. The RAC estimates that there are now more than one million potholes in the UK. The motoring group’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said that blaming EVs was “a distraction” from “the lack of preventive maintenance on our roads for too long”. The RAC expert added: “It lies with Government to provide more funding, but we’ve really need to encourage councils to carry our more maintenance with the money they’ve got.” Jack Cousens, heads of roads policy at AA, said it was “unfair and misleading” to blame potholes on EVs. “It’s a myth that desperately needs busting. “The reality is it’s the big stuff – the buses, lorries, HGVs, refuse trucks – that causes the imperfections in the tarmac. And when you get water in and it freezes, you get the expanding and contracting, and that’s what creates potholes.” Cousens laid the blame at both local and central government. He said most councils were carrying out “patch and run” work which see some potholes filled, rather than focus on comprehensive resurfacing of local road networks. “The reason for the plethora of potholes is that we haven’t maintained our road network brilliantly. It’s not been a political priority.” He added: “They are an annoyance to drivers. And they can be fatal for those on two wheels. We’ve seen coroner reports where they write to local authorities and say, ‘Your lack of pothole maintenance regime has contributed to that fatality’.” Llewellyn said he gets jealous whenever he travels to mainland Europe, saying many countries there have “incredibly smooth” roads. “There are bits of the Cotswolds where I live that are catastrophically bad. It’s been a lack of money over a long time.” However, not everyone entirely dismisses the impact of EVs. Britpave – the British Cementitious Paving Association – has warned that heavier electric cars could exacerbate the problem of poorly-maintained roads. Chairman Joe Quirke has said the nation’s roads need to be made “strong enough to withstand the additional weight of electric cars”. EV critics also point to other practical problems. Charging infrastructure is not expanding quickly enough, they argue, leaving some to queue for hours or face potential breakdowns if nearby chargers are out of action. Llewellyn said many of the most frustrating claims about EVs – they cannot travel far enough, or are far more expensive than petrol cars – once had a grain of truth, but are now completely outdated. But the pothole myth? It is simply a “stupid, pig ignorant idea” that must finally be put to bed, said the presenter. The Government was approached for comment.",UK,bing,"The article effectively challenges a popular myth about electric vehicles and their alleged contribution to the UK's pothole problem.

Pension funds warn watering down electric car targets could risk investments,Pension fund managers have warned that “chopping and changing” electric vehicle (EV) sales targets could risk investment in the UK.,https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/pensions-and-retirement/pension-funds-ev-targets-risk-investments-3390385,,2024-11-22 06:07:00,i,,"Pension fund managers have warned that “chopping and changing” electric vehicle (EV) sales targets could risk investment in the UK. There are fears that ministers could relax rules on the UK’s EV market following claims that the high sales quotas have pushed carmakers to crisis point. This would “damage investment confidence”, fund managers have told i . It comes after carmakers met the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, this week and argued that urgent action is needed to change the current system. As of 2024, carmakers must ensure that 22 per cent of car sales and 10 per cent of van sales in the UK are EVs, or they will incur a £15,000 penalty for each vehicle outside the target. However, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) predicts EV sales will only reach 18.5 per cent of the total market. Carmakers are asking the Government to adjust these quotas to relieve the pressure on the industry, although so far this has been rejected by Labour. There are warnings this could affect UK investment confidence. Giants including Phoenix Group, M&G, Aviva, and Schroders have all poured money into charging points in recent years on the basis that the mandate would help to encourage the take-up of EVs. Laura Hillis, director of climate and environment at Church of England Pensions Board, warned about making any changes. Speaking to i , she said: “Long-term investors like pension funds want to see robust, ambitious plans and policies for the transport sector in the UK. “This includes building out needed infrastructure and sending clear and consistent policy signals to the market. “Chopping and changing policy on electric vehicles would be a mistake and would damage investment confidence.” A policy change would threaten future investments across a range of green technologies, from wind and solar farms to carbon capture, sources said. Many are based on separate commitments from Sir Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, on these green technologies. Currently, the ZEV mandate will require 28 per cent of carmakers’ sales to be electric in 2025 and then gradually to 80 per cent by 2030. Bruno Gardner, head of climate and nature at Phoenix Group, said: “As an institutional investor, Phoenix Group places a high value on long-term policy and regulatory stability. “The EV mandate sets a good example for building confidence in transition investment.” Phoenix Group is calling on the Government to “build even more confidence by developing an economy-wide national transition plan with sector-specific roadmaps and capital raising plans,” he added. Adam Gillett, senior investment manager at Railpen, said: “The message to policymakers is clear: implementing the ZEV mandate effectively would stimulate investment across the zero-emissions vehicle supply chain, drive down costs and grow demand. “We need stable policy, and for market participants to work together and engage positively in this transition.” Carmakers argue that the sales targets are too high and do not reflect the true level of demand among drivers. On Monday, Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, met Nissan representatives amid warnings that the targets must be changed to reflect “reality”. Nissan bosses reportedly told Haigh that the EV mandate is endangering jobs at its sprawling works in Sunderland. Labour has emphasised repeatedly it would bring certainty to the economy, claiming it would not flip-flop on policy in the way that critics said the previous Conservative administration did. Last week, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves told business leaders at the Mansion House dinner: “By drawing a line under instability business can now plan for the future.” However, one EV industry who spoke to ministers on Monday, told the Telegraph: “There is a real risk this frightens the horses. It is being seen as a sign that as soon as things get hard, ministers will just backtrack.”",Uncategorized,bing,"The article addresses significant concerns around electric vehicle (EV) sales targets in the UK and their impact on investment confidence, particularly from pension funds.

So schneiden Elektroautos beim TÜV-Report 2025 ab!,"Der neue TÜV-Report wertet auch zehn Elektroauto-Modelle aus. Besonders schlecht schnitt der Tesla Model 3 ab. Besonders gut ein E-Auto, das nicht mehr gebaut wird: der VW e-Golf. Was sind die größten Schwachstellen der E-Autos?",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/elektroautos-im-test-beim-tuev-tesla-model-3-renault-zoe-vw-e-golf-21173001.html,,2024-11-22 06:05:00,Roland Wildberg,,"Elektroautos erobern zunehmend auch den zweiten Auto-Markt, also die Gebrauchtwagen-Welt: Nachdem im vergangenen Jahr die ersten drei Modelle regulär als Typgruppen beim TÜV aufgenommen wurden, stellt der TÜV-Report 2025 nun schon zehn Typen vor. Das heißt, dass nun ausreichend große Mengen im Fahrzeugbestand sind, um in die HU-Statistik (Überblick: Die Gewinner und Verlierer beim TÜV ) aufgenommen zu werden. Wer ein gebrauchtes E-Auto sucht, kann sich hier über die Qualität der häufigsten Modelle informieren. Was sind die Schwachstellen vom Tesla Model 3? Auweia: Kein anderes Modell (ob nun mit Elektro- oder Verbrennungsmotor) hat schon in den ersten beiden Hauptuntersuchungen seines jungen Auto-Lebens so eine hohe Mängel-Quote wie die Fließheck-Limo Model 3. Allerdings sind die Laufleistungen auch sehr hoch. Doch die starke Abnutzung entschuldigt nicht die bereits ab Werk vorhandenen Schwachpunkte. Und bei knapp 40 Vertragswerkstätten in Deutschland – VW hat rund tausend Vertriebspartner – ist die regelmäßige Wartung ohnehin kein Kinderspiel. 14,2 Prozent aller TÜV-fälligen Tesla Model 3 rasselten durch die HU – also fast jeder siebte! Damit hat sich die Quote gegenüber 2024 um 0,5 Prozent nur marginal verbessert. Zoom Der Tesla Model 3 ist Mängel-König in der Klasse der zwei- bis dreijährigen HU-Kandidaten. Bild: Olaf Itrich / AUTO BILD Die kompakte Fließheck-Limousine, mit der Tesla vor sechs Jahren in den Massenmarkt einstieg, leidet unter einem verbreiteten Elektroauto-Problem : Chassis und Bremsen können dem hohen Gewicht, das vor allem durch die Akkus verursacht wird, zu wenig entgegensetzen. 15-mal häufiger als in dieser Altersgruppe allgemein üblich ist die Achsaufhängung mängelbehaftet. Bei der Bremse ist es umgekehrt: Da Elektroautos viel rekuperieren, wird die mechanische Bremse zu selten benutzt, das führt zu Rost auf den Scheiben – die dann getauscht werden müssen. Am Licht monierten TÜV-Prüfer dreimal häufiger Defekte als durchschnittlich üblich. Zoom Elektroautos bremsen überwiegend per Rekuperation, dadurch werden die mechanischen Bremsen selten beansprucht und neigen zum Rosten (Symbolfoto). Bild: Ralf Timm Die restlichen Baugruppen, zum Beispiel Lenkung, Federn und Dämpfer, sind hingegen unauffällig. Doch gerade frühe Tesla Model 3 sind oft nur mäßig verarbeitet, auch die Lackqualität ist dürftig. Warum haben E-Autos spezielle Problemzonen? Mit den Problemzonen Bremsen und Chassis ist Tesla allerdings nicht allein: So gut wie alle Elektroauto-Modelle haben hier Schwachstellen. Die Ursachen liegen in den Besonderheiten der Konstruktion: E-Autos sind aufgrund der Traktionsbatterie besonders schwer. So wiegt die größte Batterie des VW ID.3 mit 82 kWh bereits 514 Kilogramm (Tesla gibt das Batteriegewicht nicht bekannt). Solche hohen Gewichte belasten natürlich das Fahrwerk, hohe Fahrleistungen kommen hinzu. Die Bremsen ihrerseits leiden vor allem an Untätigkeit: Elektroautos verzögern überwiegend mit der Rekuperationsbremse. Das führt bei Tesla Model 3 und anderen E-Autos dazu, dass die Bremsscheiben rosten. Verrostete Bremsscheiben müssen ersetzt werden. Das führt zu teuren und aufwendigen Instandhaltungsarbeiten. Was sind die Schwachstellen vom Renault Zoe? Wie sich die Bilder gleichen: Auch der E-Kleinwagen Renault Zoe , einst meistverkauftes Elektroauto in Europa, hat Probleme mit der mechanischen Bremse – wenn auch nicht in so hohem Maße wie der Tesla. Doppelt so viele Mängel wie im Gesamtdurchschnitt zählt der TÜV bei diesem Typ. Zumeist sind die Scheiben verrostet. Tipp für E-Auto-Fahrer: Gelegentlich auf freier Strecke (!) stark bremsen, um die Scheiben von Flugrost zu reinigen. Zoom Deutschlands E-Auto-Liebling Renault Zoe hat ebenso wie der Tesla Model 3 Probleme mit Bremse und Fahrwerk. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Auch bei dem französischen Elektro-Kleinwagen sind die Akkus zu schwer für die Basis: Schon die mittelgroße 23-kWh-Batterie bringt 462 Kilogramm auf die Waage. Und offenbar haben auch die Konstrukteure bei Renault diese Belastung zu gering eingeschätzt, sodass die Achsaufhängung zehnmal häufiger beanstandet wird als der TÜV-Gesamtdurchschnitt bei Autos dieser Altersgruppen. Querlenkerlager, Spur- und Koppelstangen geben frühzeitig auf. Gute Nachricht: Auf Lenkanlage und Lenkgelenke schlägt das offenbar nur gering durch. Insgesamt beträgt die Mängelquote 8,9 Prozent, also fällt fast jeder zehnte Zoe durch die HU. Das ist für einen jungen Gebrauchtwagen viel zu viel. Warum ist der E-Golf so gut? Ausnahmen bestätigen die Regel: Auch im neuen TÜV-Report schneidet der E-Golf bemerkenswert gut ab. Die E-Variante des Golf 7, die Volkswagen sechs Jahre hindurch (2014 bis 2020) immerhin gut 145.500-mal baute, ist mit einer Mängelquote von 3,4 Prozent tatsächlich noch besser als das Verbrenner-Vorbild! Warum ist er so viel besser als andere Elektroautos? Zoom VW baute den e-Golf von 2014 bis 2020. Erst hatte er 115 PS, ab 2017 dann 136 PS. Bild: Toni Bader / AUTO BILD Ein Grund ist der kleine Akku: Er wiegt lediglich 318 Kilogramm. Dafür müssen sich e-Golf-Fahrer auch mit einer geringen Reichweite von (je nach Motorleistung) maximal 231 km nach WLTP-Norm zufriedengeben. Diese Bescheidenheit wird durch hohe Solidität belohnt. Weder Achsaufhängung noch Lenkanlage oder Antriebswellen sind auffällig. Lediglich die Funktion der Fußbremse wird vom TÜV häufiger bemängelt als im Gesamtschnitt. Bemerkenswert: Auch die zweite HU (nach vier oder fünf Jahren) absolviert der e-Golf mit Bravour: Die Mängelquote liegt bei 4,6 Prozent, das ist fast doppelt so gut wie der Jahrgangs-Gesamtschnitt. Wie sind die Qualitäten des ID.3? Ein bisschen bizarr: Obwohl der ID.3 bewusst als Elektroauto konstruiert wurde (und die einschlägigen Schwachpunkte also nicht existieren sollten), ist seine Mängelquote etwas höher als die vom e-Golf. Das mag zum Teil an den vielen Carsharing-Exemplaren liegen, die in den ersten Jahren über ""We Share"" und andere Dienste auf die Straße kamen und von ihren Mietern erfahrungsgemäß rücksichtslos getreten wurden. Letztendlich spielt das aber keine Rolle, denn auch der ID.3 hat eine erfreulich geringe Mängelquote: Nur 5 Prozent der TÜV-Kandidaten fielen durch die Prüfung. Allerdings haben ID.3 auch vergleichsweise niedrige Laufleistungen. Zoom Der VW ID.3 hat, anders als viele populäre E-Auto-Modelle, keine schwächliche Achsaufhängung. Bild: Volkswagen AG Auffällig sind – wie bei Elektroautos schon fast üblich – die Bremsscheiben an der Vorderachse, die zu wenig genutzt werden und daher rosten. Ein Lichtblick: Da VW an der Hinterachse in weiser Voraussicht Trommelbremsen montiert, die weit weniger rostanfällig sind, ist die Erneuerung von zwei Scheiben nur halb so teuer wie bei anderen Modellen. Die Achsaufhängung des ID.3 kommt mit dem hohen Fahrzeuggewicht gut zurecht, ihre Mängelquote liegt hier im allgemeinen Durchschnitt. Weitere E-Autos aus dem TÜV-Report 2025 gibt's in der Bildergalerie: Bildergalerie Kamera Elektroautos im TÜV-Report 2025 10 Bilder Was kann man gegen rostende Bremsen bei E-Autos tun? Bisher haben die Hersteller gegen das Problem, dass bei Elektroautos die Bremsen zu wenig genutzt werden und anfangen zu rosten, keine Lösung. Vereinzelt werden an der Hinterachse Trommelbremsen verbaut. Deren Bremswirkung ist zwar etwas geringer, doch sind sie verkapselt und daher gegen Rost durch geringe Nutzung gepaart mit feuchter Witterung besser geschützt. Der TÜV rät dazu, regelmäßig kräftig zu bremsen. Um damit weder nachfolgenden Verkehr noch sich selbst in Gefahr zu bringen, sollte man das nur auf leeren Straßen tun, wenn niemand direkt hinterherfährt. Außerdem muss dazu der Getriebewählhebel auf ""N"" gestellt werden, damit der Wagen nicht automatisch rekuperiert, was die Reinigungswirkung stark herabsetzen würde. So schnitten BMW i3 und Tesla Model S beim TÜV-Report 2023 ab 2023 nahm der TÜV erstmals eine vorläufige Auswertung bei bestimmten Elektroautos vor. Unter die Lupe genommen wurden unter anderem der BMW i3 und der Tesla Model S BMW i3: glatter Durchschnitt in der TÜV-Bilanz Auf Rang zwei der ausgewerteten E-Autos fuhr 2023 der BMW i3 . Mit einer 4,7-prozentigen Durchfallquote traf er genau den Mängelschnitt. Der i3 fiel durch defekte Abblendlichter und defekte Bremsscheiben negativ auf. Tesla Model S: nicht nur bei den E-Autos weit hinten Am schlechtesten schnitt im Vierer-E-Vergleich der Tesla Model S ab. Auch hier spielt das Scheinwerfer-Thema wieder eine Rolle. Neben Mängeln am Nebellicht und Abblendlicht machen beim Models S aber vor allem die Querlenker Probleme und sorgen für eine riesige Durchfallquote: 10,7 Prozent! Der Tesla landete damit im 128-Verbrenner-Ranking nicht nur im letzten Drittel, sondern auch auf dem drittletzten Platz. Schlechter schnitten 2023 nur noch der Dacia Duster und Dacia Logan ab.",,rss,"The article offers a comprehensive analysis of how various electric vehicle models performed in the 2025 TÜV report, providing critical insights into their strengths and weaknesses based on mechanical performance and quality of parts.

Eine frische Studie zeigt auf, dass rund 250.000 Flächen entlang der Bundesfernstraßen bestens geeignet wären, um Sonnenenergie zu gewinnen. Das Bundesministerium für Digitales und Verkehr (BMDV) hatte die Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen (BASt) mit einer Analyse zum Potenzial von Photovoltaikanlagen (PV) an Bundesfernstraßen beauftragt. Das Ergebnis: Es gibt 250.000 geeignete Flächen für die solare Energiegewinnung an unseren Bundesfernstraßen.

Mit den STLA-Plattformen ändert sich das. Während STLA Medium, STLA Large und STLA Frame bereits vorgestellt wurden, bleibt die Version STLA Small noch weitgehend im Dunklen. Doch nun gibt es Aussagen von Konzernchef Carlos Tavares dazu. Die Plattform STLA Small soll 2026 starten, hieß es im Jahr 2021. Damit war schon damals klar, dass die kleinste STLA-Architektur als letzte auf den Markt kommt. Man liege zeitlich auf Kurs für einen Marktstart im Jahr 2026, sagte nun Tavares. Die Plattform werde zwischen Ende 2025 und Anfang 2026 vorgestellt, verriet er gegenüber Autocar. Sie werde für die nächste Kleinwagengeneration des Konzerns eingesetzt, also wohl für die Nachfolger des Peugeot E-208 (unser Titelbild) und des Opel Corsa Electric. Der Zeitplan von Stellantis für die Einführung der STLA-Plattformen von 2021 ist offenbar noch immer gültig Doch kann die Plattform Autos vom A- bis zum C-Segment tragen, also auch Kleinst- und Kompaktwagen. Die kleinsten Fahrzeuge auf Basis von STLA Small sollen 3.600 mm lang sein, also noch kürzer als der Fiat 500 Elektro mit seinen 3,63 Metern oder der Leapmotor T03 mit 3,62 Metern. Neben Elektroantrieben sollen auch Hybride unterstützt werden. Die Plattform soll die Common Modular Platform CMP samt ihrer elektrifizierten Variante e-CMP ersetzen, die Kleinwagen wie den Peugeot E-208, aber auch kleine Elektro-SUVs wie den Opel Mokka Electric trägt. STLA Small wird höher positioniert als die Smart Car Plattform, die unter anderem den Citroen e-C3 trägt, aber unterhalb von STLA Medium. Die Elektroautos werden Batterien zwischen 37 und 82 kWh haben, die Antriebe sollen bei 70 kW beginnen. Mit 82 kWh hätte der größte Akku so viel Speicherkapazität wie die mittelgroße Batterie im Opel Grandland Electric, der auf STLA Medium basiert und bis zu 582 km Reichweite hat. Ein Kleinwagen käme mit einer solchen Batterie locker über 600 km. ""Ich glaube, dass wir diese [die STLA-Small-Plattform] höchstwahrscheinlich Ende 2025 oder Anfang 2026 vorstellen werden, abhängig von der ersten Anwendung [also das erste darauf basierende Fahrzeug], die sich jetzt in der Vorbereitungsphase befindet“, sagte Tavares. Wie man an der Vorstellung der ersten drei Plattform sehe, liege man im Zeitplan. Unter dem Strich Von den vier geplanten STLA-Plattformen sind nun drei vorgestellt, STLA Small wird erst in einem Jahr präsentiert. Das erste darauf basierende Auto könnte gut und gern der Peugeot E-208 sein, der schon 2019 startete. Vermutlich wird die Palette dann endlich vielfältiger, denn bisher bietet der Kleinwagen nur 100 oder 115 kW sowie Akkus mit 50 oder 51 kWh brutto.

November 2024 | Tobias Stahl Stellantis hat seine nunmehr dritte Multi-Antriebsplattform „STLA Frame“ auf den Markt gebracht. Die Fahrzeugplattform soll bei Pick-ups, Lieferwagen und anderen größeren Fahrzeugen, bei denen die Karosserie auf einen Rahmen aufgesetzt ist, zum Einsatz kommen. Artikel teilen Artikel teilen Artikel teilen In die Zwischenablage kopiert Stellantis hat den Marktstart einer neuen Fahrzeugplattform bekannt gegeben. Die neue Multi-Antriebsplattform STLA Frame ist speziell zur „Unterstützung der Full-Size Pickup-Trucks, der leichten Nutzfahrzeuge und der SUVs von Stellantis“ gedacht. Sie soll als erstes bei Fahrzeugen der Marken Ram und Jeep zum Einsatz kommen und ist somit vorrangig für den nordamerikanischen Markt gedacht. Die Plattform ist als vollständig batterieelektrische Variante sowie als „Range Extended Electric Vehicle“ (REEV), also als Elektroplattform mit benzinbetriebenem Reichweitenverlängerer verfügbar. In Zukunft könne STLA Frame auch für Verbrennungsmotoren, Hybrid- sowie Wasserstoffantriebe genutzt werden, erklärt das Markenkonglomerat in einer Pressemitteilung. Damit klingt der Anwendungsbereich der Fahrzeugplattform deutlich größer als noch vor einigen Jahren – 2021 hatte Stellantis bei der Ankündigung seiner Plattform-Strategie vor allem auf den Einsatz als Elektro- und Plug-in-Hybrid-Plattform hingewiesen.

Europe Car Sales Stagnate as Electric Vehicle Weakness Persists,"Car sales in Europe are flatlining, leading manufacturers including Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to push for cost cuts in response to muted demand.",https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/11/21/europe-car-sales-stagnate-as-electric-vehicle-weakness-persists/,,2024-11-21 06:00:00,bnnbloomberg,,"(Bloomberg) -- Car sales in Europe are flatlining, leading manufacturers including Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to push for cost cuts in response to muted demand. New-car registrations inched up just 0.1% in October compared to a year ago, to 1.04 million units, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Thursday. Declines in France, Italy and the UK largely canceled out expansion in Germany, the region’s biggest car market. Automakers have struggled to grow sales in Europe as the transition to electric vehicles stumbles and a cost-of-living squeeze crimps budgets. Ford on Wednesday announced plans to cut another 4,000 jobs in the region, about 14% of its local workforce. Volkswagen is pushing for savings measures including unprecedented plant closures in Germany. Although EV sales rose 6.9% last month, they remain down for the year after policymakers reduced support for EV purchases. The UK, where registrations jumped 24% in October, has been a bright spot as manufacturers offer significant discounts to meet the government’s zero-emissions vehicle sales mandate. In Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government scrapped aid late last year, EV sales declined 4.9% in October, and are down more than a quarter after the first ten months. Porsche AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG have dialed back their EV ambitions in recent months, citing slower-than-expected momentum for plug-in models. While the German government has been weighing reintroducing some aid to support its beleaguered carmakers, it’s unclear whether it can go ahead after Scholz’s ruling coalition collapsed, inhibiting its ability to act decisively before early elections. A Europe-wide EV downturn increases the risk that manufacturers including VW, Stellantis NV and Renault SA will end up having to pay billions of euros in fines if they fail to meet stricter fleet-emission rules set to kick in next year. Buyers instead are gravitating toward hybrid vehicles powered by a combustion engine and a smaller battery, benefiting manufacturers led by Toyota Motor Corp. Sales of hybrids rose 16% last month. Volkswagen, which is locked in negotiations with unions over widespread cost cuts in Germany, saw registrations increase 13% in October. Stellantis’s sales declined 17% in the same period. --With assistance from Craig Trudell. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Business,bing,"The article presents information primarily focused on the stagnation of car sales in Europe, touching upon the weaknesses in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Aber der deutsche Markt ist selbstverständlich keineswegs repräsentativ für den Rest der Welt. Deshalb bringt Hyundai mit dem Ioniq 9 einen eigenen Setzling des Kia EV9 in den Handel, obwohl in den ersten zehn Monaten dieses Jahres nur knapp 1200 EV9 in Deutschland neu zugelassen wurden. Reichlich Platz Der Hyundai Ioniq 9 zeigt ein eigenständiges Design, ist aber ähnlich wuchtig geraten wie der EV9. Er misst mit 5,06 m in der Länge sogar noch ein paar Zentimeter mehr als der Kia. Der Radstand misst 3,13 m. Der Kunde kann unter verschiedenen Sitzkonfigurationen wählen, darunter auch die auf den ersten Pressebildern gezeigte mit vier Einzelsitzen in der zweiten und dritten Reihe. Wer es bei fünf Sitzplätzen belässt, wird wie im EV9 ein riesiges Raumangebot für Mensch und Gepäck bekommen. Das ist angesichts der beanspruchten Verkehrsfläche auch das, was man erwarten darf. Dazu gibt es vorne einen Frunk, der zwischen 52 und 88 Liter bietet. Der Kia EV9 im Test Test Elektroauto Kia EV9: Schnell voll, schnell leer​ heise Autos Die Bedienung erfolgt im Wesentlichen über das große Display in der Mitte oder über Sprachbefehle. Grundfunktionen wie Temperatur oder Lautstärke haben eigene Regler. Auch auf dem Lenkrad verzichtet Hyundai auf Touchflächen, was den Eindruck verstärkt, dass sich die Entwickler bemüht haben, die alltäglichen Funktionen möglichst einfach bedienbar zu machen. 110 kWh, 260 kW Ladeleistung Anzeige Der Ioniq 9 kommt ausschließlich mit batterieelektrischen Antrieben auf den Markt. Die Batterie hat mit einem Energiegehalt von 110 kWh noch etwas mehr zu bieten als im EV9. Geladen werden kann sie in der Spitze unter idealen Bedingungen mit bis zu 260 kW. Dank einer Vorkonditionierung lässt sich das nach einer gewissen Anfahrtzeit auch im Winter nutzen, sofern die Ladeinfrastruktur vor Ort mithalten kann. Die maximale Reichweite unter den Bedingungen des WLTP liegt bei 620 km. Angeboten wird der Ioniq 9 mit drei Antrieben. Das Basismodell mit einem Motor im Heck bietet 160 kW. Diesen E-Motor haben alle Versionen. In den Allradlern kommen vorn entweder ein 70-kW-Motor oder einer mit 160 kW hinzu. Die Systemleistung liegt dann bei 230 oder 320 kW. Alle Versionen werden auf 200 km/h begrenzt. Bild 1 von 12 Hyundai Ioniq 9 (12 Bilder) Der Hyundai Ioniq 9 wirkt live nochmals deutlich wuchtiger als auf den Bildern. (Bild: Hyundai ) Preis: vermutlich ab 70.000 Euro In den USA und Südkorea wird der Hyundai Ioniq 9 bereits Anfang des kommenden Jahres eingeführt. Wann das große Auto auf dem europäischen Markt zu haben ist, steht noch nicht exakt fest. Wir rechnen mit einem Start noch in der ersten Jahreshälfte, obwohl aus den eingangs genannten Gründen Europa eine untergeordnete Rolle in den Überlegungen spielt. Einer allzu großen Verbreitung steht schließlich auch der Preis entgegen.

Four electric vehicle trends that will help you transition to net zero,Technology and legislation evolves rapidly in the developing electric vehicle sector. We highlight some potential changes which will impact fleets.,https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/features/four-electric-vehicle-trends-to-watch-out-for,,2024-11-20 10:04:00,Fleet News,,"This feature was taken from our Electric Fleet: Moving to Net Zero special report. Technology and legislation evolves rapidly in the developing electric vehicle sector. We highlight four potential changes which will impact fleets: 1 Battery health 2 Battery chemistry 3 Plug-and-charge 4 Wireless charging Calls are continuing from the automotive sector to introduce battery health certificates for electric vehicles (EVs), with the aim of giving confidence in the technology to used car buyers as well as better inform residual value setters. Under its Plan for the Automotive Sector, published in October 2023, Labour pledged to introduce a standardised battery health certificate for used EVs. The Government has also helped the UN develop a global technical regulation on United Nations Global Technical Regulation Number 22 on EV batteries (GTR 22), says Abdul Chowdhury, head of vehicle policy at the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV). “GTR 22 provides the requirement for a battery state of health monitor which is in an easily accessible manner, such as through the vehicle’s dashboard, so, essentially, you get a battery health figure like you do on your iPhone,” he adds. “It also details minimum performance standards for EV batteries, which have already been incorporated into UK regulations through the ZEV Mandate’s warranty requirements. “Secondly, the regulations also mandate that the batteries need minimum performance standards so they are not degrading quicker than they should. “Historically, the mileage of a vehicle was a strong indicator for its life expectancy and you could examine an engine to see if the head gasket was about to go, for example. “Obviously, you can’t do that in the same way for a battery and that’s where there could be a role for things like battery health certificates to help correctly assign a value for the vehicle.” In research published last month telematics provider Geotab analysed the battery health of almost 5,000 fleet and private EVs, representing nearly 1.5 million days of data, and found batteries degrade, on average, by 1.8% per year. This compares with 2.3% when it last performed a wholesale analysis of EV battery health in 2019. It found batteries in high-use EVs did not show significantly higher battery degradation than in lower use vehicles. David Savage, vice-president for the UK and Ireland at Geotab, says: “With these higher levels of sustained health, batteries in the latest EV models will comfortably outlast the usable life of the vehicle and will likely not need to be replaced. “The fact is that a 1.8% decline in battery health is unlikely to have a significant impact on most drivers’ daily vehicle needs, and this number will only come down further with new EV models and improved battery technology.” Battery degradation is a natural process that permanently reduces the amount of energy a battery can store or the amount of power it can deliver. The traction battery is essentially the heart of an EV – it is the single most expensive component and also has a critical bearing its operation, having a huge influence on factors such as range and charging speeds. Currently, all production EVs sold in the UK use lithium-ion chemistry, but different manufacturers may choose different ingredients for their battery cells. For example, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) is one of the most popular chemistries, but many manufacturers are looking to reduce their use of nickel and cobalt – therefore cutting costs – in their batteries, or switching to alternatives such as lithium-ion phosphate (LFP). The share of LFP batteries in EV sales remains below 10%, with high-nickel chemistries still most common, says the International Energy Agency. “Further declines in battery cost and critical mineral reliance might come from sodium-ion batteries,” it adds. “The need for critical minerals like nickel and manganese for sodium-ion batteries depends on the cathode chemistry used, but no sodium-ion chemistries require lithium.” However, for many experts solid-state batteries are the Holy Grail for EVs as they offer greater range, faster charging times and increased safety over lithium-ion units. The major advantage they have is that they use solid electrolytes as opposed to liquid. In practical terms, this gives them a greater energy density which means they can hold anywhere between two to 10 times the energy of a similar-sized lithium-ion battery. They will also charge faster as the solid electrolyte will not suffer the same over-heating issues as the liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries. Degradation will also be lower. Furthermore, as solid-state batteries do not have the flammable liquid electrolytes of a lithium-ion battery, they also have a much lower risk of fire. “The rollout of DC ultra-fast charging, combined with solid-state batteries, could allow us to move to a situation where the recharging of the battery can be much more akin to the petrol station experience by really cutting down on those charging times,” says Jonathan Davenport, senior director analyst at technology analysts Gartner. Car manufacturers are keen to adopt the technology, with Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz all known to be developing it. Mercedes-Benz, for example, expects its next-gen batteries to go into production for passenger vehicles by 2030, with Nissan setting a date of 2029. “We are finally in the phase of scaling up on our solid-state battery line,” says Shunichi Inamijima, corporate vice-president at Nissan. “Our solid-state battery technology is a game-changer for making EV sales grow explosively.” Under plug-and-charge, an EV driver will simply be able to plug their vehicle into a charge point and the two will automatically process payment information: no payment cards or apps will be needed. It uses standard ISO 15118, which is a new form of encrypted communication between an EV and a charge point, and involves asymmetric cryptography: a pairing of public and private security keys, neither of which can be decrypted without the other. This allows for a high degree of data security and integrity, and means that once an EV owner has set up their payment and authentication information, everything else is taken care of. “Plug-and-charge will really simplify things for fleets,” says Jonathan Davenport, senior director analyst, of technology analysts Gartner. Tesla developed its proprietary version of plug-and-charge 10 years ago. Octopus Electroverse also offers access to the technology, although this is limited to a small number of Volkswagen Group cars and BMWs on just the Ionity charging network. Gartner expects the technology will enter the mainstream within the next five to 10 years. Davenport says one potential obstacle to this is the current dominance by existing large credit card/payment providers that have brand awareness and who may feel their market presence may be threatened by the advent of an alternative payment solution. A second trial of electric vehicle wireless charging is currently underway in the Midlands, further investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of the technology. Being led by Coventry University and Coventry City Council, in collaboration with Cenex, the Dynacov – short for dynamic charging of vehicles - initiative uses a coil implanted just below the road surface that establishes a connection with vehicles and charges them wirelessly as they drive over. The technology could be deployed for buses and logistics vehicles, says the university. “Solutions like this will enable the transition to electric vehicles to happen more quickly,” adds Jim O’Boyle, Coventry City Council’s cabinet member for jobs, regeneration and climate change. The project is being funded by National Grid Electricity Distribution and is focused on a section of Kenilworth Road at its junction with the A45. If successful, it is hoped this project will attract Government support and funding to further develop the technology. Coventry University was also involved in the Wireless Charging of Taxi (WiCET) trial in Nottingham, which ran for four months and ended in January last year. This saw a fleet of electric and range-extender taxis wirelessly charge using five 11kW induction charging pads installed in the ground in the taxi rank in Trent Street, outside the central railway station, while they were stationary and waiting for their next fare. Nine vehicles - five LEVC TXs and four Nissan eNV200 Dynamo taxi conversions – were modified so they could charge when the driver, using the guidance of an HMI screen in the cabin, aligned their vehicle over a ground pad. The system was able to differentiate between cars and the appropriate drivers were then billed through a web-based app, meaning they did not have to leave their cars at all during the charging process. The wireless charging system achieved 90% power transfer efficiency, which makes it comparable with plug-in chargers. “The charging facility was aimed at top-up charging rather than being a replacement for plug-in charging,” says Richard Sander, technical consultant and project manager at Cenex, which led the initiative. He likens this approach to ‘grazing’, where the battery is kept at a consistent state of charge instead of running the battery down and then recharging fully. Overall findings showed wireless charging works and would have numerous benefits for many fleets, says Sander. “Some benefits will be very obvious, some less so,” he adds. “It’s very easy to use once the driver is used to it. “They drive up, line up and the EV starts charging until they drive away. It avoids having any cables lying around which can get damaged or be trip hazards, so it’s perfect for operational working areas. “There are not any exposed electrical contacts, so it’s well suited to dirty environments; there are no moving mechanical parts, so there is less wear and tear. “There is the potential to deploy it with minimal or no street furniture/hardware on the charging site, and if you can deploy it for top-up charging you could potentially reduce the size and weight of the propulsion battery within the vehicle.” Decarbonising a fleet is not just about replacing an ICE vehicle with a like-for-like electric replacement – it may open the door to other, more operationally efficient transport modes. In our new Electric Fleet: Moving to Net Zero special report, we look at the fleets that are already utilising flying drones, rolling robots or powered mobility such as e-cargo bikes and light vehicles, assessing use cases and considerations for organisations looking to pilot these options. We also look ahead to forthcoming battery electric technology to evaluate its potential impact on fleet operations, with longer ranges and faster charging among the key benefits, as well as the potential of hydrogen, which is undergoing a number of Government-funded trials in the UK. Other topics we investigate include the ongoing impact of the ZEV Mandate and how fleet managers need to be prepared to take advantage of any potential deals offered by manufacturers, and technology trends – including batteries – which will have an influence on fleet operations. We also look at what fully-electric cars will hit the UK market over the next 12 to 18 months, some of which will offer a WLTP range of more than 400 miles.",Business,bing,"The article provides a comprehensive and detailed exploration of various emerging trends within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, specifically focusing on fleet operations.

"Most popular used electric cars could save owners £1,600 compared to petrol",The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said a study shows a requirement for each manufacturer to sell a minimum proportion of zero emission vehicles each year 'is working',https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/business/most-popular-used-electric-cars-34146465,,2024-11-20 08:24:00,The Mirror,,"Owners of the UK's most popular second-hand electric vehicles (EVs) could pocket an average saving of £1,600 annually compared to their petrol counterparts, new research suggests. \ The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), which carried out the study, noted that since early 2023, savings have increased as used EVs are ""no longer more expensive to buy"". The think tank believes this indicates that the policy requiring carmakers to sell a certain quota of zero emission vehicles (Zev) each year ""is working"". This comes ahead of a meeting between ministers and automotive industry leaders on Wednesday to consider relaxing the mandate. The ECIU's analysis considered the six top-selling EV models in the UK, evaluating their total cost of ownership, including purchase price and running expenses like electricity, against their petrol equivalents. The Audi e-tron topped the list with potential annual savings of about £2,600, while the Renault Zoe offered the least at approximately £875 per year. Since January 1, under the zero-emission vehicle (Zev) mandate ( introduced by the Tory government, a minimum of 22% of all new cars sold by each manufacturer in the UK this year must be emissions-free, typically meaning fully electric. This percentage is set to increase yearly until it hits 100% by 2035. Manufacturers who fail to comply with the mandate or do not utilise available flexibilities, such as rolling over credits from previous years, face a Government fine of £15,000 for every non-compliant vehicle sold over the limit. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has calculated that new electric vehicles purchased while the zero-emission vehicle mandate is active could save future second-hand buyers close to £40bn by 2035, as reported by The Sunday Times. Transportation Secretary Louise Haigh and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds are gearing up for discussions with car manufacturers, who are aiming to ease the mandate regulations. According to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the market for pure electric pre-owned cars is booming, with record sales seen lately. Some 53,423 of the cars were acquired between July and September, a significant jump of 57% from the same period in the previous year. Colin Walker, a transport analyst at ECIU, commented: ""Increasing numbers of regular families are now trading in for an EV on the second-hand market, taking advantage of the hundreds of pounds of savings they can generate every year, and turning their backs on paying the ‘petrol premium’ of their old car."" He praised the effectiveness of the prior government's Zev mandate policy, noting: ""The previous government’s Zev mandate policy is working, with manufacturers discounting their EVs as they compete for sales to hit their targets. 'As prices are driven down, sales are going up. The increasing number of new EVs being sold today will hit the used market in around three to four years’ time, opening up the opportunity for cheaper and cleaner electric driving to the majority of people, as most people buy their cars second-hand.

Grundlage der Zahlen ist die Bundesnetzagentur, die regelmäßig die verfügbaren Ladepunkte ausweist, wie zuletzt zum Stichtag 1 Juli 2024. Den Zahlen zufolge standen für öffentliche Laden exakt 142.793 Ladepunkte zur Verfügung. Zum Stand 1. September sind sogar rund 3100 weitere hinzugekommen, an der Quote pro Auto ändert sich dabei aber wenig. In Deutschland waren Mitte 2024 laut Kraftfahrzeug-Bundesamt rund 2,48 Millionen E-Autos (auch Plug-in-Hybride) angemeldet. Dabei handelt es sich um all die öffentlichen Ladepunkte, die das Anzeigeverfahren der Bundesnetzagentur vollständig abgeschlossen haben und im Internet veröffentlicht wurden. (Hier ist die offizielle Ladesäulenkarte ). Die tatsächliche Zahl der Ladepunkte dürfte mittlerweile noch etwas höher liegen. Wo man noch gar nicht öffentlich laden kann Allerdings sticht ein nicht ganz so positiver Wert hervor: In einem Drittel der 10.752 Gemeinden in Deutschland gibt es noch keine einzige öffentlichen E-Auto-Ladestation, 73 Prozent verfügen über keine Möglichkeit zum Schnellladen . Immerhin ist bei der Entwicklung der Ausbau zu spüren: Vergangenes Jahr war noch die Hälfte aller Gemeinden ohne öffentliche Ladeinfrastruktur, die Zahl der schnellladelosen Gemeinden lag sogar bei 80 Prozent. Wie steht es ums Schnellladen? Beim Schnellladen teilen sich derzeit im Bundesdurchschnitt 82,4 E-Autos eine Ladesäule. Hier verglich das VDA die Verteilung auf Ebene der Bundesländer. Auch dieser Wert zeigt den Ausbau des öffentlichen Ladenetzes: vor einem Jahr kamen noch 111 E-Autos auf einen Schnellladepunkt. Allerdings spricht die Bundesnetzagentur schon oberhalb von 22 kW von Schnellladen, in der Industrie gilt eine Ladeleistung oberhalb von 150 kW als HPC-Laden (High-Power-Charging).

Volkswagen, meanwhile, admitted it might be forced to cut thousands of staff, as well as reduce salaries and potentially close factories in Germany due to a slump in sales across the board. Fiat has also temporarily stopped production of its 500e at its Turin plant. The Autoblog has listed every car due to disappear in 2025, including the top 5 performance motors. JAGUAR F-TYPE In July, a company spokesperson for Jaguar Land Rover announced that production of the XE, XF and F-Type sportscar had finished. What's more, the small E-Pace SUV and the I-Pace EV, which are both produced at their Austrian facility, will no longer be produced from December 2024. However, one model, the F-Pace, will see its production run extended into 2025. Jaguar Land Rover's CEO Adrian Mardell revealed at an investor’s day earlier this year that the manufacturer is fully committed to becoming a luxury, all-electric brand. In a statement to Top Gear, Jaguar said: ""As JLR transitions to its electric future, current Jaguar production of XE, XF and F-Type came to an end in mid 2024, while the I-Pace and E-Pace in partnership with Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria will come to an end in December 2024. ""Current F-Pace production at Solihull and local manufacturing for China will continue for the foreseeable future. “The sale of all current nameplates continues throughout 2024 and in some markets well into 2025. ""Jaguar will begin an exciting new era as a pure-electric luxury brand with vehicle production commencing at our Solihull facility from 2025. “The Jaguar retail partners, and service network remains fully operational and will continue to deliver unparalleled levels of customer care and attention to our current Jaguar clients."" ALFA ROMEO GIULIA QUADRIFOGLIO & STELVIO QUADRIFOGLIO These two high performance twins are also for the chop. The Giulia Quadrifoglio has always thrilled among the sports sedans with its twin-turbo V6. While its sibling, the Stelvio Quadrifoglio, boasts a 505-horsepower engine and immaculate handling, stands out among SUVs. But this is only the end of the line for its combustion engine varieties. Head of Alfa Romeo and Fiat North America Larry Dominique said: ""This is the final chance to own a Quadrifoglio with only combustion engine technology as we continue our metamorphosis to an electrified future, but this is not the end of the story."" CHEVROLET CAMARO The Chevrolet Camaro's special-edition Panther proved to be a swansong, with the golden age American muscle car being pulled from production. A mainstay among high-horsepower American classics, it will be missed by gear heads across the world. Scott Bell, VP of Global Chevrolet, said: ""While we are not announcing an immediate successor today, rest assured, this is not the end of Camaro’s story.” World’s smallest budget car that was immortalised on Top Gear once sold for just £166… but now it’s worth a fortune NISSAN GT-R Nicknamed the ""Godzilla"", this motor defined Nissan's performance lineup for years, with its acceleration and handling - but sadly it's been overtaken by competition more recently. A Nissan spokesperson said: “13 years after its European introduction as the icon of accessible automotive high performance, we can confirm that European GT-R production will end in March, 2022 due to the new EU & UK drive by noise regulations starting 1st of July 2021 (No. 540.2014).” TOYOTA GR SUPRA 2.0 The Toyota GR Supra's 2.0-litre four-cylinder variant will not be seen beyond 2025. The Supra will only have the 3.0-litre six-cylinder going forward, but with its sibling's departure, car lovers will have even fewer affordable lightweight sports cars to choose from. AMAZING TIME TO BUY ELECTRIC The electric market is currently in a slump as manufacturers slash prices with record discounts. Carmakers are scrambling to up their zero-emission sales to comply with increasingly tightening Net Zero laws. The new Government has confirmed it will reinstate the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 after former PM Rishi Sunak delayed it to 2025. Plenty of firms have already self-imposed earlier deadlines to make the all-electric transition in an attempt to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, Jaguar won't sell a new car in the UK for a whole year as bosses prepare to phase out petrol power altogether in 2026. But every brand is still subject to the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. The legally-binding regulations force manufacturers to ensure that a certain portion of their sales are electric vehicles, with the percentage increasing each year up to the total ban. This year's requirement is 22%, with firms fined up to £1,500 per car they produce over the limit. Already, bosses at Ford have said they will have to make fewer petrol models to balance their stats. However, others are trying to get the EVs flying out the doors by slapping them with heavy discounts. DS, the luxury arm of Citroen, is leading the way, with an average drop of 35.7% on the 3 Crossback. That means that new models are cut from over £37,000 to under £25,000, according to data from AutoTrader. MG isn't far behind with a 34% dip for the 5 and 30% for the ZS. Even Tesla, which isn't bound by the Mandate since it only makes EVs, has dropped the Model 3 from £42,000 to £39,000 in the past year. Ian Plummer, commercial director at AutoTrader, commented: ""That sort of discount finally makes it possible for the consumer to make a rational decision to buy an EV, rather than base it on emotional reasons such as environmental factors. ""It’s going to be very painful [for manufacturers]. ""They are going to be selling EVs at a loss in many cases and they will have to arbitrage those losses with the profits they can still make on their diesel and petrol vehicles."" The only issue is that EVs remain stubbornly more expensive on average than their petrol counterparts, despite the discounts. This is largely to do with the costs associated with developing brand new electric platforms, rather than re-using already established internal combustion specs. As a result, brands can only cut prices so much to stimulate demand before losses become unsustainable. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry body the SMMT, explained: ""The ZEV mandate compels manufacturers to produce, but it does not compel consumers to buy.""",Business,bing,"The article offers a mix of current industry happenings and impacts due to the shift towards electric vehicles, including details on classic cars being phased out and recent market trends.

Your Guide to All-Electric Vehicle Charging,"New EVs like the Acura ZDX are changing the game. Here's the 411 on choosing the right car, charging tech, and installation plan.",https://www.menshealth.com/technology-gear/a62919983/your-guide-to-all-electric-vehicle-charging/,,2024-11-15 19:00:00,Men's Health,,"Electric vehicles have come a long way since the first modern EVs hit the roads in the early 2000s. A combination of factors, including improved battery life, charging technology, and design, have drivers increasingly saying goodbye to gas tanks in favor of EVs, whether they live in small towns, suburbs, or cities. The Edison Electric Institute and the Institute for Electric Innovation, for example, project that 26.4 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. This increase in EV sales also means that charging technology has rapidly expanded and improved, now including home charging, portable charging, and public charging. If you’re thinking of introducing an EV to your garage, such as the all-electric Acura ZDX Type S, which has up to a 278 mile EPA Range Rating*, Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive with nearly 500-hp providing a smooth driving experience, and three charging packages suited to different lifestyles, it’s important to get acquainted with the technology that will power your car. Here’s everything you need to know about charging in order to go electric. Home Charging Home charging is ideal for drivers with high daily mileage or a strong preference for dedicated home infrastructure. This type of charger will usually be mounted on your wall and rely on a dedicated line to your electrical panel to charge your vehicle. This uses the most electricity, and thus usually requires hardwire installation—meaning you’ll have to connect it directly to your electrical system to account for the higher electrical demand—but it’s the fastest way to reach a full charge. Acura’s Home Charging Bundle includes a Home Charging Station that allows drivers to charge at their own convenience, a $500 AHE (Acura Home Electrification) installation credit that can assist with these set-up costs, and a $100 charging credit** on the EVgo charging network that can be used as a back-up when away from home. Acura The Acura ZDX Type S with the Acura Home Charging Station. Your home itself may dictate what’s possible in terms of installation, says Joel Worthington, the president of a nationwide electricity-services provider. ""Some older homes may need an electrical upgrade for the EV equipment, which can increase the installation time,” he says. “With newer homes, however, the EV installation can typically be installed in a few hours by an electrician."" In some cities, new homes are required to come with EV-charging capacity. Regardless, one thing’s for sure—any home installation should be done by professionals. “Hiring a licensed electrician with experience in the installation of EVs can simplify the process and help ensure that the charger will be set up safely,"" adds Marty Stadelmaier, EVP of customer service at a Colorado-based electric management company. The AHE credit in Acura’s Home Charging Bundle can help cover the cost of hiring a professional. Portable Charging Portable chargers are a great option for drivers who travel frequently, live in rental properties, or otherwise value flexibility. These will utilize existing outlets at your home or on the go, allowing for more flexible charging without requiring a full installation. The speed with which you can reach full charge with a portable model depends on the voltage of the outlet you’re using, so you may end up needing to upgrade the outlet itself if you want faster charging speeds; generally speaking, industrial-grade outlets are recommended. Acura’s Portable Charging Bundle includes a Portable Charging Kit, a $250 AHE installation credit to help cover those potential outlet upgrades, and a $300 charging credit** on the EVgo network. Acura The interior of the Acura ZDX Type S. Public Charging Public charging stations are great for city dwellers, frequent travelers, and those who are otherwise always on the go.

Your Guide to All-Electric Vehicle Charging,"Here's the 411 on choosing the right car, charging tech, and installation plan. Electric vehicles have come a long way since the first modern EVs hit the roads in the early 2000s. A combination of factors,",https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a62752398/your-guide-to-all-electric-vehicle-charging/,,2024-11-15 16:08:00,Popular Mechanics,,"Electric vehicles have come a long way since the first modern EVs hit the roads in the early 2000s. A combination of factors, including improved battery life, charging technology, and design, have drivers increasingly saying goodbye to gas tanks in favor of EVs, whether they live in small towns, suburbs, or cities. The Edison Electric Institute and the Institute for Electric Innovation, for example, project that 26.4 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. This increase in EV sales also means that charging technology has rapidly expanded and improved, now including home charging, portable charging, and public charging. If you’re thinking of introducing an EV to your garage, such as the all-electric Acura ZDX Type S, which has up to a 278 mile EPA Range Rating*, Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive with nearly 500-hp providing a smooth driving experience, and three charging packages suited to different lifestyles, it’s important to get acquainted with the technology that will power your car. Here’s everything you need to know about charging in order to go electric. Home Charging Home charging is ideal for drivers with high daily mileage or a strong preference for dedicated home infrastructure. This type of charger will usually be mounted on your wall and rely on a dedicated line to your electrical panel to charge your vehicle. This uses the most electricity, and thus usually requires hardwire installation—meaning you’ll have to connect it directly to your electrical system to account for the higher electrical demand—but it’s the fastest way to reach a full charge. Acura’s Home Charging Bundle includes a Home Charging Station that allows drivers to charge at their own convenience, a $500 AHE (Acura Home Electrification) installation credit that can assist with these set-up costs, and a $100 charging credit** on the EVgo charging network that can be used as a back-up when away from home. Acura The Acura ZDX Type S with the Acura Home Charging Station.

Doch SUVs sind die beliebteste Autoklasse in Deutschland, deswegen wollen wir Ihnen wieder etwas Gleichwertiges bieten. Unsere alte Bilderstrecke enthielt über 80 Modelle – für eine Liste ist das zu viel. Daher haben wir uns entschlossen, die Übersicht in drei Teile aufzugliedern. Hier ist der erste Part mit den Modellen bis 4,30 Meter Länge; geordnet sind die Autos nach Länge. Los geht's! Dacia Spring Facelift (3,70 m) Der Dacia Spring erhielt im Sommer 2024 ein Facelift. Dabei änderte sich vor allem die Optik außen und innen, während Antriebe und Akkus gleich blieben. Das heißt: Nach wie vor schafft das Auto nicht mehr als 220 km. Auch die Crashsicherheit hat sich nicht erhöht – der Wagen erhielt im EuroNCAP-Test nur einen einzigen Stern, und das nach den Standards von 2021. Immerhin sind die Preise ähnlich günstig wie früher. Sie beginnen nun bei 16.900 Euro; damit ist der Wagen nach wie vor das günstigste Elektroauto auf dem Markt (wenn man Leichtfahrzeuge à la Opel Rocks Electric ausnimmt). Basispreis: 16.900 Euro Frontantrieb mit 33 bzw. 48 kW 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 19,1 bzw. 13,7 Sek. / 125 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 27 kWh brutto / 225-228 km Ladeleistung: einphasig mit Wechselstrom (AC), optional bis 30 kW Gleichstrom (DC9 Ladedauer: 8h28 mit AC (3,7 kW), 45 min mit DC (20-80%) Maße: 3,70 m Länge / 2,42 m Radstand / 1,51 m Höhe / 308-1.104 Liter Kofferraum Hyundai Inster (3,83 m, noch nicht bestellbar) Mit 3,83 Meter Länge ist der Hyundai Inster das zweitkleinste Elektro-SUV nach dem Dacia Spring. Vorgestellt wurde das Auto im Juni 2024; damals hieß es, ein Preis von rund 25.000 Euro werde angestrebt. Ein genaues Marktstartdatum gibt es noch nicht. Für den Antrieb sorgen wahlweise ein 71- oder ein 85-kW-Motor. In die Basisversion wird ein 42-kWh-Akku für rund 300 km Reichweite eingebaut, die gehobene Variante soll rund 355 km schaffen. Basispreis: ca. 25.000 Euro (noch nicht bestellbar) Frontantrieb mit 71 bzw. 85 kW 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 11,7 bzw. 10,6 Sek. / 140 bzw. 150 km/h Akku/Reichweite: 42 bzw. 49 kWh / ca. 300 bzw. 355 km DC-Ladedauer: 30 min (beide Akkus, 10-80%) Maße: 3,83 m Länge / 2,58 m Radstand / 1,58 m Höhe / 351-1.059 Liter Kofferraum Fiat Grande Panda Elektro (3,99 m, noch nicht bestellbar) Der Fiat Grande Panda Elektro basiert wie der Citroen e-C3 auf der der Smart Car Platform, die besonders günstige Modelle ermöglicht. Mit 3,99 Meter ist der Wagen rund 18 cm kürzer als der Fiat 600 Elektro. Für den Antrieb sorgt ein 83 kW-Motor vorne, der sich den Strom aus einer LFP-Batterie mit 44 kWh holt. Die Preise sollen bei rund 25.000 Euro beginnen. Basispreis: ca. 25.000 Euro (noch nicht bestellbar) Frontantrieb mit 83 kW Akku/WLTP-Reichweite: 44 kWh (LFP) / ca. 320 km Max. Ladeleistung: vermutlich 3,7 kW einphasig mit AC, 100 kW mit DC DC-Ladedauer: vermutlich 26 min (20-80%) Maße: 3,99 m Länge / 2,54 m Radstand / 1,57 m Höhe / 361 Liter Kofferraum, Maximalvolumen nicht bekannt Citroen e-C3 (4,01 m) Im Oktober 2023 wurde ein veritabler Knaller vorgestellt: der Citroen e-C3. Seit Februar 2024 ist das Auto bestellbar. Das Besondere: Das 4,01 Meter lange Kleinwagen-SUV kostet nur 23.300 Euro. Dafür bekommt man einen 83-kW-Frontantrieb und eine 44-kWh-Batterie mit Lithium-Eisenphosphat-Chemie (LFP) für immerhin 300 km Reichweite. Aufgeladen wird mit bis zu 100 kW Gleichstrom, einen 11-kW-Bordlader gibt es nur optional. Auch einen Touchscreen gibt es nur bei der gehobenen Version. Technische Basis ist eine neue Billig-Plattform namens Smart Car Family. Basispreis: 23.300 Euro Frontantrieb mit 83 kW 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 11,0 Sek. / 132 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 44 kWh / 321-326 km Ladeleistung: einphasig (optional 11 kW) mit AC, serienmäßig 100 kW mit DC Ladedauer: 2h50 mit 11 kW AC (20-80%), 26 min mit DC (20-80%) Maße: 4,01 m Länge / 2,54 m Radstand / 1,57 m Höhe / 310 Liter Kofferraum, Maximalvolumen noch nicht bekannt Jeep Avenger (4,08 m) Der Jeep Avenger ist das erste Elektroauto der Marke; er ist seit Anfang 2023 bestellbar. Der Hersteller bezeichnet das Modell als SUV, doch die Höhe von 1,53 m ist geringer als beim VW ID.3, man kann sich also streiten. Der nur 4,08 Meter lange Wagen basiert jedenfalls auf der altbekannten Plattform eCMP; anders als ältere Modelle gibt es hier nur den neueren Elektroantrieb mit 115 kW und eine 54-kWh-Batterie. Damit ergeben sich rund 400 km Reichweite. Die Preise beginnen (nach einer Preiserhöhung im März) bei 38.500 Euro. Basispreis: 38.500 Euro Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,0 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 390-400 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 5h34 mit AC, 24 min mit DC (20-80%) Maße: 4,08 m Länge / 1,78 m Breite / 1,53 m Höhe / 355-1.252 Liter Kofferraum DS 3 E-Tense (4,12 m) Im April 2023 verlor der DS 3 Crossback E-Tense die Bezeichnung ""Crossback"" und heißt nun nur noch DS3 E-Tense. Außerdem erhielt er den neuen Elektromotor mit 115 statt 100 kW und eine größere Batterie mit 54 statt 50 kWh. So stieg die Maximalreichweite von 340 auf 404 Kilometer. Zunächst begannen die Preise bei arg unrealistischen 45.540 Euro, inzwischen ist die Basisversion für 41.500 Euro zu haben – immer noch ziemlich happig, aber das dürfte auch an der umfangreichen Ausstattung liegen. Basispreis: 41.2070 Euro (Ausstattung Pallas) Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,1 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh / 395-404 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 5h30 mit AC, 35 min mit DC (0-80%) Maße: 4,12 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,53 m Höhe / 350-1.050 Liter Kofferraum Renault 4 E-Tech Electric (4,14 m, noch nicht bestellbar) Der elektrische Renault 4 basiert wie der R5 auf der Plattform AmpR Small, gehört jedoch mit 1,57 m Höhe jedoch zu den kleinen SUVs. Die Technik ist vom Schwestermodell bekannt, allerdings wird die kleinste Motorisierung mit 70 kW hier nicht angeboten. So hat man die Wahl zwischen 90 und 110 kW, wobei die bekannten Batterien mit 40 bzw. 52 kWh eingebaut werden. Die Reichweiten sind mit rund 300 bzw. 400 km ähnlich wie beim R5 E-Tech Electric. Basispreis: k.A. Frontantrieb mit 90 kW / 225 Nm oder 110 kW / 245 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: ca. 9-8,5 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 40 oder 52 kWh netto / ca. 300 bzw. 400 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 80 bzw. 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 30 min mit DC (15-80%) Maße: 4,14 m Länge / 2,62m Radstand / 1,57 m Höhe / 420 Liter Kofferraum, Maximalvolumen nicht bekannt Opel Mokka Electric (4,15 m) Den Opel Mokka Electric erhielt im Herbst 2024 ein Facelift; dabei entfiel die Version mit 100 kW und 50-kWh-Akku. Damit gibt es nur noch die stärkere Variante mit 115 kW und größerer Batterie, die für 403 km nach WLTP reichen soll. Außerdem wurde das Auto endlich billiger. Statt 40.800 Euro werden nur noch 36.740 Euro für die Basisversion verlangt. Basispreis: 36.740 Euro Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,2 bzw. 9,0 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 403 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 5h15 mit AC, mit DC 27 min (""bis zu 80%"") Maße: 4,15 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,53 m Höhe / 350-1.060 Liter Kofferraum Alfa Romeo Junior (4,17 m) Der Alfa Romeo Junior sollte ursprünglich Milano heißen, aber auf Druck der italienischen Regierung wurde er kurz vor Marktstart noch umbenannt. Der Wagen basiert auf der Stellantis-Plattform eCMP und ist wie der Fiat 600 Elektro 4,17 Meter lang. Beim Antrieb gibt es eine Überraschung: Außer mit dem 115-kW-Motor gibt es auch einen mit 207 kW, der in die Version Veloce eingebaut wird. Die Preise beginnen bei 39.500 Euro, den Veloce gibt es für sehr ambitionierte 48.500 Euro. Basispreis: 39.500 Euro Frontantrieb mit 115 bzw. 207 kW / 260 bzw. 345 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,0 bzw. 5,9 Sek. / 150 bzw. 200 km/h Akku: / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 398-410 km (115 kW) Max. Ladeleistung: 11 kW mit AC, 100 kW mit DC DC-Ladedauer: < 30 min (10-80%) Maße: 4,17 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,53 m Höhe / 400-1.265 Liter Kofferraum Fiat 600 Elektro (4,17 m) Der Fiat 600 Elektro sieht aus wie eine aufgepumpte Version des Fiat 500 mit Elektroantrieb, doch die Technik stammt nicht vom kleinen Bruder, sondern von der Stellantis-Konzernplattform eCMP. So ist das 4,17 Meter lange Auto ein Schwestermodell des Alfa Junior, Opel Mokka Electric und Jeep Avenger. Für den Antrieb sorgt der 115-kW-Motor, der Strom kommt aus der 54-kWh-Batterie. Damit sollen rund 400 km drin sein. Das Auto ist seit Juli 2023 konfigurierbar; angeboten werden die Version Red für 36.490 Euro und die Launch-Edition La Prima für 42.990 Euro. Basispreis: 36.490 Euro (Red) Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,0 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 409 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: k.A. Maße: 4,17 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,52 m Höhe / 360-1.231 Liter Kofferraum Volvo EX30 (4,23 m) Der Volvo EX30 startete dann im Dezember 2023. Das Elektro-Einstiegsmodell hat Maße wie der VW ID.3, doch Volvo bezeichnet das Auto als SUV – wegen der hohen Sitzposition und großen Bodenfreiheit. Wie der Smart #1 und #3 basiert der EX30 auf der Plattform SEA von Konzernmutter Geely; wie dort gibt es einen 200-kW-Heckantrieb und einen Allradler mit 315 kW.

Cheapest electric cars 2024: affordable EVs,"Price is one of the main factors preventing motorists from trading in their petrol or diesel car for an electric one, so we’ve put together a list of the cheapest electric cars on sale in 2024.",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/electric/cheapest-electric-car/,,2024-11-12 00:00:00,CAR Magazine,,"► Our list of the cheapest electric cars on sale ► Options range from dinky quadricycles to SUVs ► Prices start from just £7695 Price is one of the main factors preventing motorists from trading in their petrol or diesel car for an electric one, so we’ve put together a list of the cheapest electric cars on sale in 2024. The fact is, the best electric cars cost significantly more than their conventionally powered peers because the materials in their battery packs and electric motors are expensive – and few manufacturers are prepared to make a loss on each EV they sell. But there are signs this is changing, and 2024 is proving turning point with the introduction of more affordable EVs including the £15,000 Dacia Spring and Citroen’s low-price e-C3 retailing at a whisker under £22k. Recent months have seen several car makers cut the price of their EVs in a bid to make them more attractive, with manufacturers under greater pressure to meet electric car sales targets that came into force in 2024. The cheapest electric cars on this list might not have the fancy interior technology and safety equipment you’ll find in something like a Tesla Model 3, and they might not have the glamour of the best electric luxury cars, but you can’t argue with the value. The best cheap electric cars at a glance: Below, we’ve rounded up the cheapest electric cars on sale in the UK today. Our list includes tiny electric quadricycles, family-sized electric hatchbacks and compact electric SUVs. This list has changed in recent months due to the introduction of new models and a price cut to existing EVs. We’ve also included links to our dedicated review for each electric car if you need some extra information on how they drive. Scroll down for some inspiration. The cheapest electric vehicles (EVs) to buy in 2024 Citroen Ami – from £7695 Best for: City-only driving Pros: Minuscule dimensions, great fun, no car will get more attention Cons: Bad ride, you’ve seen the video of one being rolled in Monaco, right? Citroen had one goal in mind when it was designing the Ami – to build the ultimate small electric car. And it bashed the nail on the head with a 20lb sledgehammer. The Ami is perfectly suited to city life. It’s small, so it can fit down narrow alleys. Its cabin is surrounded by glass, so you can spot kamikaze moped riders long before you could in a conventional car. Plus, because it’s electric, you don’t need to pay Sadiq Khan a single penny to drive into the centre of London, at least for now. The only fault with the Ami is that it only works in the city. It has a maximum range of 46 miles and a top speed of just 28mph. That’s more than enough for zipping around Knightsbridge but nowhere enough to venture out of the city and onto an A-road. It’s achingly slow. Stay within the confines of town, and you’ll be king of all you survey, though. The Ami is more than nimble enough to carve up Civics and Golfs on roundabouts, while its 8bhp motor is sprightly enough to surprise them at the lights. Read our full Citroen Ami review Citroen Ami Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Dacia Spring – from £14,995 Best for: The cheapest ‘proper’ electric car you can buy Pros: Cheaper than an equivalent petrol city car, impressive interior, decent equipment Cons: Questionable safety, small range limits usability Brits have previously been deprived of the value-packed Dacia Spring, one of the most popular electric cars across Europe. But that changes later in 2024 when a new version of the Spring lands in the UK. A compact city that’s quite a lot smaller than the Sandero, the Spring grabs the headlines with a starting price of just £14,995, making it by far the cheapest proper electric car available. Finance deals have been confirmed from £169 a month with a £2325 deposit on a four-year PCP lease deal, with interest at 3.9% APR. The new Spring is powered by a fairly small 44bhp motor as standard, with a dizzying 64bhp available from higher-spec versions. A 26.8kWh battery allows for a claimed range of up to 140 miles, giving scope for some out-of-town trips but you wouldn’t want to go too far as it’s not very quick to charge with a maximum 30kW DC rapid charging rate. Standard kit includes a digital instrument cluster, cruise control and rear parking sensors as well. The Spring is available to pre-order now and the first right-hand drive UK cars are expected by October. To find out more read our full Dacia Spring review Leapmotor T03 – from £15,995 Best for: Urban commuters seeking a budget-friendly electric option Leapmotor is only just now on the cusp of reaching European shores thanks to distribution networks from Stellantis. It’s been developed almost entirely in-house – even the battery is homegrown, aside from a few of the cells – but some of the styling quirks seem familiar. Specs-wise, the T03’s 37.3 kWh battery provides a WLTP-rated range of 165 miles. A modest 93bhp motor yielding a 0-62 mph time of 12.7 seconds, but that’s enough for city driving and outperforms similar budget EVs like the Dacia Spring. The build quality feels solid for a car in this price range, and features include five doors and a spacious cabin with decent headroom. Buyers should note its limited 165-mile range and shorter-than-average warranty, though. Read our full review of the Leapmotor T03 here. Citroen e-C3 – from £21,990 Best for: Cheap and the promise of comfort Pros: Good range, great price, very comfortable Cons: Slow steering, boot is an awkward shape Citroen already has a fairly expansive line-up of electric models, but it’s hunting the cheaper end of the market with its new e-C3, which arrives as part of a fourth generation of Citroen’s popular supermini. Getting a chunkier look to appeal to SUV-loving buyers, the e-C3 comes with the firm’s trademark comfy suspension and seats, and it’ll likely prove a great daily driver. Orders are yet to open but it’s expected to arrive in the UK before the close of 2024, and makes for a great option with its 199-mile range and quick 100kW DC charging. It drives well, is surprisingly spacious and comes with plenty of kit as standard, with an attractive £21,990 starting price considering it’s a much more rounded car than the Spring. Find out more and read the Citroen e-C3 review BYD Dolphin – from £26,140 Best for: Those wanting something different Pros: Fantastic value for money, interesting interior, comfortable ride Cons: MG4 is better to drive for similar money, intrusive safety tech Chinese brand BYD gives you a lot of car for the money with its amusingly named Dolphin, which is far larger than the other cars on this so far. It has enough space inside for four adults, plus it has a 345-litre boot. The cheapest £26,140 model features a 45kWh battery allowing a claimed maximum range of 211 miles, but a larger 60kWh unit increases this to 265 miles. It even drives quite well. Sure, it isn’t as polished as a European electric hatchback, such as a Cupra Born, but it still offers plenty of grip and manageable levels of body roll. And, if you opt for the more expensive 60kWh 201bhp version, you’ll have a car that can dash from 0–62mph in 6.7 seconds. The interior is quirky, too – the infotainment screen is mounted on a motor and can spin through 90 degrees to be either portrait or landscape.

That said, the EV model has always been scuppered by its expensive price. But Vauxhall has addressed the Corsa’s high price with the addition of a new value-packed ‘Yes Edition’, that drops the Corsa EV’s starting price by a significant £5,550. You still get the same 134bhp electric motor and 50kWh battery enabling a claimed 221 miles from a charge too. And it’s not like Vauxhall has ripped out all the equipment either, as you still get LED headlights, keyless entry and a 10-inch touchscreen to name just a few highlights. To find out more read our full Vauxhall Corsa Electric review Vauxhall Corsa Electric Lease Deals VIEW OFFER MG 4 EV – from £26,995 Best for: Everything, really Pros: Great to drive, long range, plenty of tech Cons: Interior feels a bit cheap, iffy reliability Like the Dolphin, the MG 4 EV is another Chinese electric hatchback. But, where the BYD focuses on comfort, the MG majors on driver engagement. It’s arguably the best-driving car in its class, running rings around the likes of the Volkswagen ID.3 while simultaneously shaving thousands off its asking price. When you’re pushing really hard, the MG 4’s rear-driven platform will even allow you to slide the back end out, just like a sports car. It’s a riot. Happily, the MG 4 is more than just a one-trick pony. It’s practical, too. There’s enough space in the back for two adults, and it has a reasonably sized 363-litre boot. Granted, the ID. 3’s rear seats are more comfortable for adults, and its boot is slightly larger at 385 litres, but you should expect to make a few sacrifices when the price gulf between the two cars is more than £8,000. The beauty of the MG 4 is that you make fewer sacrifices than you’d expect. To find out more read our full MG 4 EV review MG 4 EV Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Mazda MX-30 – from £27,995 Best for: Those wanting a quirky electric SUV that priorities fashion over functionality Pros: Cool design, high-quality interior, good to drive Cons: Poor electric range, not very practical The MX-30 trades on its styling, which is just as well because it’s absolutely hopeless at covering distance. That’s because it has a tiny 35.5kWh battery pack, whereas most of its rivals have batteries of 50kWh or more. The result? A maximum WLTP range of 124 miles and a best-case real-world range of only 100 miles. Ouch. Still, you should at least have fun on your distance-restricted outings because, like most Mazdas, the MX-30 is fun to drive. It is also loaded with interesting design features, such as reverse-opening rear doors, wooden trim on the centre console and soft door card trims made from recycled plastic bottles. While previously quite tough to recommend, Mazda has recently slashed prices by £3,000, making it seem a whole lot more appealing at £27,995. Read our Mazda MX-30 review Mazda MX-30 Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Fiat 500 Electric – from £28,195 Best for: The fashion-conscious Pros: Looks great, drives well, recent price cut Cons: Range isn’t amazing with standard trim, isn’t particularly practical We like the Fiat 500 Electric. It’s by no means the fastest, most practical or longest-legged electric hatchback on sale – but it does have the biggest character. Just like its petrol-powered predecessor, it’s ideally suited to the city. However, it’s sophisticated enough to allow you to tackle faster roads. Providing you keep a mental note of all the nearby charging stations, that is. The entry-level model only has a tiny 24kWh battery that offers a maximum official range of 118 miles. The 500e has always been quite expensive by city car standards, but Fiat has recently slashed its price to improve sales. It now starts from £21,995 for the entry-level 24kWh version, with a 118-mile range. We’d recommend paying the £24,995 for the larger 42kWh battery, which manages a claimed 199 miles between charges. It’s good to drive and gets lots of tech for such a small car car, but isn’t very practical so is best treated as a two-seater. To find out more read our full Fiat 500 Electric review Fiat 500e Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Nissan Leaf – from £28,495 Best for: Affordable and spacious electric motoring Pros: Lots of space, easy to use, relaxing to drive Cons: Soon to be discontinued, outdated charging tech What the Nissan Leaf lacks in range and fast-charging tech, it claws back with its affordable price tag. The most basic cars cost from £28,495 – and even the flagship Tekna variant (with its Bose audio system and clever driver assistance kit) will give you back a fiver’s change from £32,000. These days, you can only have the Leaf with a 39kWh battery, giving you a maximum range of 168 miles. Its electric motor serves up 148bhp, but the Leaf never encourages you to drive spiritedly. Its suspension is set up for comfort, and its steering is rather light and vague, which means it’s at its happiest bumbling along at 10mph under the speed limit. Nissan has recently stopped production of the Leaf as it gears up to launch its next generation of EVs, so vehicles are available from stock only. Nissan Leaf Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Peugeot e-208 – £28,600 Best for: Stylish all-rounder Pros: Stylish design, Easy to drive, lots of equipment Cons: Awkward driving position, not all that spacious The Peugeot e-208 has always been a credible small electric car, but with one caveat: its high price. The French firm seems to be acknowledging this now, with a recent price cut meaning this supermini now comes in at £28,600, and reduces the gap between EVs and petrol models. Though not everyone will get on with Peugeot’s trademark awkward driving position, the e-208 is otherwise very easy to drive and live with, gets a decent range of 224 miles (claimed) and is arguably the best-looking supermini you can buy too. Standard equipment also includes climate control, LED lights and a 10-inch touchscreen too. To find out more read our full Peugeot e-208 review View Peugeot e-208 Lease Deals VIEW OFFER What is the cheapest electric car to buy today? That depends on your definition of ‘car.’ The cheapest fully enclosed, road-legal, four-wheeled vehicle you can buy is the Citroen Ami, priced from just £7695. However, it isn’t legally recognised as a car – it’s a pure-electric quadricycle. The cheapest proper electric car you can buy is the Dacia Spring, which costs from just £14,995. Are electric cars getting cheaper? Gradually, with much of that change being driven by Chinese manufacturers. Falling R&D costs, economies of scale, and the presence of smaller, less upmarket electric cars to sit alongside the big electric SUVs and saloons that kickstarted the whole shift towards electrification mean the market’s becoming ever more friendly to those on a budget. With manufacturers increasingly under pressure to shift more EVs to meet mandatory sales targets, we’re seeing more firms cut the prices of their existing models to boost demand. Cupra, Honda, Mazda and Vauxhall have all slashed the prices of their electric cars in recent months. This will trend will only likely continue later in 2024. Is it worth buying a used electric car? Buying any used car always means you’ll take on a certain amount of risk, but EVs are a different kettle of fish. The positives? There are far fewer parts to go wrong, and most are loaded with technology. But the value of an EV hinges on the condition of its battery pack – and if the cells have been thrashed by the car’s previous owner, you could end up with a lemon that won’t do half of its claimed range. On newer EVs, you shouldn’t need to worry. There are some significant savings on nearly-new cars to be had if you’re not bothered about being the first person to have their name on the V5. We’ve compiled a guide to buying a used EV that includes a list of the best cars you might want to consider. Follow the link above to learn more. Are there any cheap EVs worth waiting for? In 2024 we’ll see the arrival of two far more affordable EVs mentioned in this article. The first is the new Dacia Spring, a car that’s been on sale in other European countries for several years, but will now come to the UK for the first time, with a starting price of just £14,995. Citroen’s e-C3 will be a larger and more substantial offering on top of that, and be available for less than £23,000, again undercutting the opposition. Are electric cars cheap to charge? That depends on where you charge your electric car. Plug in at a motorway rapid charger at peak times, and you could end up spending more on electricity than you would for a tank of fuel in an equivalent petrol car. However, you could save hundreds of pounds if you charge up at home using a wallbox charger and an intelligent charge scheduler that can reap the benefits of an off-peak electricity tariff.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a comprehensive list of affordable electric vehicles in 2024 and touches on the evolving price trends in the EV industry.

The Citroen Ami leads in terms of price, available for as low as £7,695, though it is a quadricycle and not a traditional car. The Dacia Spring, available from £14,995, is considered the most affordable true EV and is set to launch in the UK market. Other budget-friendly models include the Citroen e-C3 and the Leapmotor T03, both offering good range and reasonable driving experiences for their price points. Manufacturers are increasingly reducing prices to meet new electric sales targets and compete within the growing EV market. As a result, there is a shift towards smaller, more affordable models that cater to budget-conscious consumers. The increased presence of Chinese manufacturers in the market, leveraging economies of scale and reduced R&D costs, further indicates a trend towards declining EV prices. However, charging costs can vary significantly based on where the vehicle is charged, with home charging often being more economical than public rapid chargers."
Meet e-Vitara: Suzuki’s first battery-electric car,CAR magazine UK reveals the first details of the new Suzuki e-Vitara - the brand's first battery-electric production car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/suzuki/evitara/,,2024-11-11 17:29:00,CAR Magazine,,"► Suzuki e-Vitara SUV revealed ► It’s the brand’s first electric production car ► Design is based off eVX concept Suzuki has revealed its first-ever battery-electric production car: the new e-Vitara. Feels a bit weird for this to be the brand’s first, given how far along so many other brands are with their electrification strategies. But Suzuki will not be rushed, instead relying on partnerships with Toyota to offer full and plug-in hybrid models as it develops its own technology. The design of the new e-Vitara is based off the eVX concept – a small, chunky EV show car that first made its debut at the 2023 Tokyo Auto Salon. It’s chunky and bulky in all the usual SUV ways, with plenty of cladding and an aggressive frown on its face. Inside, the new e-Vitara has a pair of screens for driver’s instruments and infotainment, and a reasonably tidy interior layout that includes physical switchgear. The more interesting bits are under the skin, though. Suzuki has used a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack here – known for being cheaper and less reliant on rare earths than a more conventional lithium-manganese-cobalt mix – and it runs on a battery-electric version of its ‘HEARTECT’ platform that underpins countless other models. For Europe, the e-Vitara comes in a few powertrain flavours. The entry level model features a 49kWh battery pack and a single e-motor on the front axle developing 142bhp. There are also two power variants for the larger 61kWh battery pack: a 172bhp front-driven model or a 236bhp all-wheel drive model. All e-Vitara models feature an ‘e-axle’ that incorporates the electric motor and inverter, with the all-wheel drive model also featuring a Trail drive mode for extra grip off-road. Range and performance figures haven’t been announced yet. ‘We will provide a variety of options, including BEVs, hybrid vehicles and CNG behicles tailored to specific regions,’ says Toshihiro Suzuki, company president. ‘Following the launch of the e-Vitara, we will continue to expand our BEV line-up.’ The new e-Vitara will go on sale in the summer of 2025.",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article offers a fresh perspective on Suzuki's entry into the electric vehicle market with its first battery-electric production car, the e-Vitara.

New small but mighty electric vehicles to push boundaries for last-mile logistics,"ELM Mobility, a new joint venture from two UK pioneers, is pushing ahead with plans to launch a groundbreaking new last-mile EV from 2028. Rally and vehi",https://fleetworld.co.uk/new-small-but-mighty-electric-vehicles-to-push-boundaries-for-last-mile-logistics/,,2024-11-11 14:30:00,Fleet World,,"ELM Mobility, a new joint venture from two UK pioneers, is pushing ahead with plans to launch a groundbreaking new last-mile EV from 2028. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Rally and vehicle technology specialist Prodrive has teamed up with design agency Astheimer in a move to create the first ground-up, fit-for-purpose last-mile delivery platform, which they say will transform safety, versatility and efficiency for fleets around the ground. A demonstrator has already debuted at Cenex Expo 2024 and the next step will see the project go into production readiness ahead of certification. Pre-series production vehicles will be trialled by customers, with start of UK production planned for 2028. Prices are expected to start from around £25,000. According to both firms, current last-mile EVs fall short in terms of reliability, safety, driver comfort and payload volume, or are simply too large and costly for the task in hand. Their zero-emission Evolv quadricycle demonstrator showcased at Cenex Expo tackles this, with a cubic load capacity rivalling mid-size vans. Unveiled just 12 months after the project received a share of a £22.7m investment from the UK government’s Department for Business and Trade (DBT), via the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC), the Evolv demonstrator is a small L7e category quadricycle that the firms say offers the same load capacity and passive safety crash standards as N1 small vans. Its compact footprint measures just 3,240mm long, 1,450mm wide, 2,150mm high and weighs 850kg with batteries, but it’s able to pack in 4m3 using two load spaces, putting it on a par with some mid-size vans. The main load area can accommodate a 1.6m tall Euro pallet with a 300kg payload. It’s accessed on the side via secure self-locking sliding doors and has a 300mm load bed height. The secondary load area, accessible through rear ‘barn doors’, provides additional space for a 1.2m tall Euro pallet and 200kg payload. Able to be driven with a standard car licence, the demonstrator is equipped with a 20kWh battery to enable a 100-mile (62km) range with a top speed of 50mph (80km/h) but other battery capacities are under consideration for the production models, and will be explored in the next phase of development. These are expected to have a 20-80% AC charge time of less than two hours. The interior has been designed around the driver ergonomics. The central driver seat offers easier access from either side and provides better visibility of pedestrians and cyclists through the wraparound windscreen; it also streamlines the number of variants for the UK and European markets. The flexible platform will allow for a family of models, adaptable to the needs of each customer. The demonstrator has a tight 7.8m turning circle and is also designed for high uptime and low maintenance. Following its unveiling at Cenex Expo, the electric quadricycle is now being used to advance discussions with stakeholders and potential customers in logistics, retailing and food deliveries. Dr Iain Roche, CEO of Prodrive Advanced Technology, said: “Evolv demonstrates how our collective innovative design and engineering can push the boundaries of what a last mile EV can achieve.

Best used electric cars 2024: Top 10 second-hand EVs to buy,The Independent's Electric Vehicles Channel is sponsored by E.ON Next. Now is the perfect time to buy a secondhand EV – and with sales of used electric cars growing faster than new EV sales ...,https://www.independent.co.uk/cars/electric-vehicles/best-used-electric-cars-evs-uk-b2611282.html,,2024-11-11 00:14:00,The Independent,,"SPONSORED BY E.ON NEXT The Independent's Electric Vehicles Channel is sponsored by E.ON Next. Now is the perfect time to buy a secondhand EV – and with sales of used electric cars growing faster than new EV sales right now, it’s easy to see why. Electric cars tend to lose their value pretty quickly, in some cases falling by as much as 50 per cent in the first year alone, and while that’s an uncomfortable thought for new owners, it’s fantastic news if you fancy picking up a used-car bargain. Fears that electric car batteries won’t last long enough are quickly becoming a thing of the past now, too – as we proved when testing a decade-old Tesla Model S with more than 250,000 miles on the clock. Crucially, that car was still using its original battery, and had 84 per cent of its original capacity remaining. That – along with frequent software updates than fix bugs and even add new features years after they launched – is just one reason why the Model S and smaller Tesla Model 3 appear among our ten favourite used EVs to buy in the UK. A key point to remember when buying a used EV is, if it has been serviced correctly, the battery will likely still be covered by its eight-year manufacturer warranty. This means if the battery, of its ancillary components, fail during that time, the manufacturer will fix or replace the faulty parts without any costs coming back to you. The two Kias on our list get the remainder of their seven-year manufacturer cover for used car owners. You should also remember that, as with all used-car buys, condition and history are crucial. So make sure you delve into the car and its history, and also check for reviews of the seller, too. Only when you’re 100 per cent happy, do the deal – and enjoy the comfort, refinement and low running costs electric cars have to offer. How we tested As with all our car tests, we start by understanding the needs of the buyer – and in the secondhand market there are different priorities, especially around reliability and build quality. So we’ve looked into all that, while also talking to owners and looking into owner surveys to see if people are happy with their cars after a period of time living with them. Value also comes into it – cars depreciate at different rates and what might not be the best buy new, can look all the more attractive when it comes to sitting on a used forecourt. Plus, of course, there are still the things that a car has to do for you, so we assess the cars in the real-world situations you’ll drive them in, and check on running costs over a typical ownership period.

Running costs for the I-Pace are relatively low for a vehicle of its performance and luxury level. Jaguar’s reputation for reliability isn’t great, but the I-Pace was built in Austria by Magna, so quality over the long term should be better than some of the British-built Jags. 6. Renault Zoe: From £4,850, Renault.co.uk Best: For small families open image in gallery Renault Zoe ( Renault ) Independent rating: 7/10 Pros: Ideal for town use Ideal for town use Cons: Driving position, build quality, some batteries on lease Driving position, build quality, some batteries on lease Price: From £4,850 From £4,850 Maximum claimed range: 249 miles 249 miles Maximum charge rate : 46 kW : 46 kW Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,087 x 1,787 x 1,562 mm : 4,087 x 1,787 x 1,562 mm Boot space: 338 litres The Renault Zoe is one of the most popular small electric cars in the UK, offering an affordable entry point into EV ownership. The Zoe is particularly well-suited to urban driving, with its compact dimensions and nimble handling making it easy to manoeuvre through city streets. Despite its small size, the Zoe offers a decent range, with newer models capable of up to 249 miles on a single charge, which is impressive for a car in this segment. Beware of cars with the battery on lease, though – you’ll have to pay an extra monthly fee. It was a silly idea, that Renault eventually dropped. Reliability is generally good, although it’s important to check the condition of the battery on used models, as this can affect both range and performance. The Zoe’s build quality is decent for its price point, although the interior is more functional than luxurious, with hard plastics used throughout. However, the cabin is well-designed, with a simple and intuitive layout that’s easy to live with on a daily basis. Read our full Renault Zoe review Comfort levels are good, with a smooth ride and supportive seats, although the driving position is a bit upright with limited adjustability. The Zoe’s compact size does limit interior space, but it’s still practical enough for small families, with adequate space for kids in the back and a reasonably sized boot. The driving experience is okay, with the Zoe offering brisk acceleration and a light, easy-to-drive nature and good visibility that makes it perfect for urban environments. Running costs are one of the Zoe’s strongest points – it’s reasonably efficient and has minimal maintenance requirements. The Zoe is also exempt from road tax and benefits from low insurance costs, making it an affordable option for those on a budget. Overall, the Renault Zoe is a practical, affordable, and reliable electric car that’s perfect for city living, making it a popular choice in the used market. 7. Volkswagen ID.3: From £10,500, Volkswagen.co.uk Best: For fun open image in gallery Volkswagen ID.3 ( Volkswagen ) Independent rating: 7/10 Pros: Good to drive, efficient, loads of space Good to drive, efficient, loads of space Cons: Flawed infotainment system Flawed infotainment system Price: From £10,500 From £10,500 Maximum claimed range: 336 miles 336 miles Maximum charge rate : 125 kW (model year dependent) : 125 kW (model year dependent) Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,264 x 1,809 x 1,564 mm : 4,264 x 1,809 x 1,564 mm Boot space: 385 litres The Volkswagen ID.3 represents a significant shift for VW as it marks the company’s first purpose-built electric vehicle on its new MEB platform. The ID.3 is designed to be the “electric car for the masses,” offering a blend of affordability, practicality, and modern design that appeals to a wide audience. With a range of up to 340 miles in the Pro S version, the ID.3 provides one of the most competitive ranges in its class, making it suitable for both city driving and longer journeys. Early ID. 3s didn’t live up to Volkswagen’s reputation for high-quality interiors – the materials used inside feel cheaper than owners of Volkswagen Golfs, for example, would be used to. The cabin is spacious, with plenty of room for passengers in both the front and rear, and the boot is a practical size, making the ID.3 a great option for families. Read our full Volkswagen ID.3 review Comfort is another area where the ID.3 excels. The ride is smooth and composed, with the suspension doing a good job of absorbing bumps and imperfections in the road. The seats are comfortable and supportive, making long journeys more enjoyable. The ID.3 is also quiet on the move, thanks to its electric powertrain, which enhances the overall comfort level. When it comes to driver appeal, the ID.3 offers a pleasant driving experience, with light and responsive steering and decent acceleration, particularly in the more powerful versions. It’s not a performance car, but it’s enjoyable to drive and feels stable and secure on the road. There are some neat design touches, like the pause and play symbols on the brake and accelerator pedals Running costs for the ID.3 are low, as you’d expect from an electric vehicle, while Volkswagen’s reputation for reliability adds to the appeal, making the ID.3 a solid choice in the used EV market. 8. Tesla Model S: From £13,000, Tesla.com Best: For long range open image in gallery Tesla Model S ( Tesla ) Independent rating: 7/10 Pros: Technology, space, charging network Technology, space, charging network Cons: Build quality, ride comfort Build quality, ride comfort Price: From £13,000 From £13,000 Maximum claimed range: 393 miles 393 miles Maximum charge rate : 250 kW (model year dependent) : 250 kW (model year dependent) Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,970 x 1,964 x 1,445 mm : 4,970 x 1,964 x 1,445 mm Boot space: 793 litres The original Tesla in the UK, the Model S, has set the standard for electric vehicles since its launch. The Model S combines exceptional range, blistering performance on some models, and cutting-edge features in a sleek, sophisticated package. With ranges of up to 405 miles in the Long-Range version, the Model S is still the benchmark for long-distance electric travel – and the prices make it more tempting than ever, especially with a few cars still getting free Supercharging for their owners. Build quality in the Model S has improved significantly over the years, but it had to; early models had some issues with panel gaps and interior fit and finish. The interior is minimalist and modern, with a massive central touchscreen that controls nearly all the car’s functions. The the cabin is spacious and comfortable, with plenty of room for passengers and luggage. Comfort levels in the Model S are mixed with a firm ride on some models. The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the cabin is also very quiet, with minimal wind and road noise, which enhances the overall sense of luxury. Driver appeal is where the Model S truly excels. With its dual-motor all-wheel-drive system and instant torque, the Model S delivers supercar-like acceleration in some models. The handling is also impressive, with precise steering and a low centre of gravity that makes it feel agile and responsive, despite its size. Running costs for the Model S are low, particularly when compared to similarly powerful petrol or diesel vehicles. The all-electric powertrain means low ‘fuel ‘costs, and Tesla’s Supercharger network makes long-distance travel easy and affordable. Tesla’s over-the-air software updates mean that the car’s technology remains up-to-date, adding to its appeal. 9.

Known for its compact size and nimble handling, the Corsa Electric is particularly well-suited to city driving. Owners often praise the car’s smooth and quiet performance, which contrasts favourably with traditional petrol models, while there should be plenty of choice with decent availability on the used market. In terms of reliability, the Corsa Electric generally performs well. The electric motor is known for being dependable, with very few reports of major issues. The battery has shown to maintain good range over time, though it’s wise to check the battery health before purchasing. Vauxhall offers an 8-year or 100,000-mile warranty on the battery, which provides some peace of mind. Read our full Vauxhall Corsa Electric review Build quality is respectable, with a sturdy feel to the interior and exterior. However, some owners have noted that the cabin materials are not as premium as those found in some rivals like the Peugeot e-208. The infotainment system is functional but can be slightly slow, especially on older models. Owners typically report a positive ownership experience, appreciating the low running costs and ease of driving. The Corsa’s compact dimensions make parking straightforward, and its range is generally sufficient for daily commuting. 10. Kia EV6: From £24,500, Kia.com Best: For style open image in gallery Kia EV6 ( Kia ) Independent rating: 6/10 Pros: Generous warranty, great style, fast charging Generous warranty, great style, fast charging Cons: Firm ride, limited headroom Firm ride, limited headroom Price: From £24,500 From £24,500 Maximum claimed range: 328 miles 328 miles Maximum charge rate : 235 kW : 235 kW Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,695 x 1,890 x 1,550 mm : 4,695 x 1,890 x 1,550 mm Boot space: 490 litres Another Kia on our list and not just because of the remains of the seven-year warranty that used buyers will benefit from. The EV6 is a sporty, spacious hatchback that has persuaded many premium car owners to switch to Kia. And it’s easy to see why with great looks and a smart interior that’s packed with tech. You might find headroom a little tight in the front, but there’s loads of space in the back, while the boot is an okay size, if not enormous. Kia has made great strides in quality in recent years and the EV6 is the perfect example. The brand’s reputation for reliability is building strongly, too. We’d avoid the fast and four-wheel drive versions unless that’s what you really want – the rear-wheel drive car offers the best blend of value and range, and it’s still great to drive despite the car’s weight. The payoff for sporty handling is a rather firm ride, though. Fast charging at an appropriate public charger is a real bonus, as is a level of equipment inside even the more basic models, with every car getting a good roster of safety kit, too. The EV6 is far from the cheapest used EV you can get, but the benefit of that warranty means you’ll have even less to worry about than on rival used models. Electric car FAQs Are electric cars cheaper to run? When it comes to ‘fuel’ and maintenance, yes they are. They can still be expensive to buy – unless you can get a good deal – and insurance can be a bit pricier at the moment, but prices are coming down for both. Are electric cars actually better for the environment? With zero emissions from usage, they are far better for the local environment. How long do electric cars last on full charge? It depends on the size of the battery and car. Currently ranges of new EVs go from around 120 miles up to over 400 miles. Will electric cars get any cheaper? They already are – the Dacia Spring costs from £14,995. Prices and leasing deals are getting more affordable Which electric car brands are most reliable? All electric cars tend to be more reliable than petrol or diesel cars as they have fewer moving parts. Nissan – which launched the first EV – has a good reputation for reliability. The verdict: Electric cars Buying a used electric car isn’t the worry it once was. In fact, the increase in the number of people buying a used EV is currently outstripping those buying new. Worries about the longevity of batteries are a thing of the past. As you can see in our Should You Buy A Used EV video, we drove a Tesla Model S that was over nine years old, had covered over 250,000 miles and still had 84 per cent of its original battery capacity left. That’s not unusual – Tesla told us of all the cars it sells under its certified pre-Owned programme, they never see a car under three-years old with less than 90 per cent of its capacity. So it’s no surprise to see a couple of Teslas on this list: the Model 3 and the Model S represent the best value due to the sheer numbers available, although we could see the Tesla Model Y joining the list at some stage. It’s one of the original EVs that tops the list – the BMW i3. The little i3 is still a sensational car today and proves how ahead of its time. Even the early model with the smaller battery and a range of around 100 miles is perfect for zipping around towns and cities. We’ve got perfect family models here, like the Kia Niro and the Renault Zoe, and if you fancy a bit of luxury, the Jaguar I-Pace is great value right now. Another one of the originals, the Nissan Leaf also makes our list, while there are newer models like the Kia EV6 and Volkswagen ID. 3 that are popular enough used to be great secondhand buys. So the bargains are out there, and if you’re on a smart energy tariff like E.ON Next Drive, running costs can be super-low, too.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a comprehensive list of top used electric vehicles to consider in 2024, highlighting different options based on various use cases such as city driving, family suitability, technology features, and luxury.

Drive smarter and cut costs using our expert advice. Get our Cars newsletter – it's free, monthly Best hybrid cars A hybrid car combines a petrol engine (or, occasionally, a diesel) with an electric motor. To maximise efficiency, energy that would usually be lost as heat when decelerating and braking is recovered to a battery which, in turn, powers the electric motor. They are typically most effective in urban scenarios, where stop-start driving maximises the potential for energy recovery and low speeds allow most models (excluding 'mild' hybrids) to be driven solely on electricity, though normally only for short distances. Furthermore, they’re cheaper to buy than a comparable full-electric model and get around the inconvenience of charging times and limited range. From a driver perspective, a full hybrid car is no different to own and operate than a conventional petrol car, although to get the best out of it you will need to adapt your driving style with a focus on gentle braking and acceleration. One of the major benefits of hybrid cars is reduced fuel consumption. It’s even more noticeable with PHEVs, which can often complete daily drives on electric alone. We measure real-world fuel consumption in multiple scenarios, so you know how much each car costs to run. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert Plug-in hybrid models (PHEVs) offer greater electric driving range (typically around 20-50 miles), thanks to a larger battery. The idea is that you can do most of your day-to-day driving on electricity alone, while having the flexibility of a petrol engine for longer trips. However, to get anywhere near their impressive fuel-economy claims, you’ll need to keep the battery topped up as much as possible. Our tests have revealed that once it’s depleted, a PHEV can be less economical than a comparable petrol-only model. Popular hybrid models include the Toyota Corolla, Honda Jazz, Kia Niro Hybrid, Honda Civic and Toyota RAV4. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best hybrid cars or see our pick of the best hybrid SUVs. Best electric cars Smooth, cheap and emission-free driving is the dream that electric cars promise to fulfil, and there are plenty of models out there that offer exactly that. But they aren’t for everyone. All but the very largest EVs won’t go as far on a single charge as a conventional fossil fuel-powered car, and charging times are longer than a quick fill-up at a service station. Electric cars can be extremely cheap to run, but only if you charge from home. And although the upfront cost of EVs can be high, the UK’s Zero Emissions Vehicle Mandate (ZEV) requires a certain proportion of manufacturers’ car sales to be EVs, meaning there are some huge discounts to be found on new or nearly-new EVs. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert One issue you may want to consider is access to charging facilities. Unless you have a private home charger, you’ll be reliant on the more expensive public charging network – something to consider, particularly if you’re drawn to EVs for their potential cost savings. Find out more in our guide to EV charging costs. If you're concerned about the reliability of EVs, the Which? car survey collates the ownership experience of thousands of owners to find out just how reliable their cars are. The information we collect informs our reviews; if a car is known to break down often, it can’t be a Best Buy. Popular electric models include the Nissan Leaf, Kia Niro EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Volkswagen ID.4. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best electric cars or check out our guide to the cheapest electric cars and best small electric cars. Best small cars The traditional small hatchback remains a firm favourite among UK motorists, and it’s not hard to see why. The best models offer decent practicality, including comfortable seating for four, in a package that’s easy to park in a tight spot, with relatively low running and maintenance costs. Small cars can be deceptively spacious. Some have clever designs that create surprisingly roomy interiors. Our lab tests measure available cabin and boot space across all cars, which often differ from manufacturer claims. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert This is the car class where you are more likely to see compromises, though. Some models do without key safety equipment, such as centre airbags, which makes them more likely to perform poorly in crash tests, rendering them a Don’t Buy. Popular small cars include the Honda Jazz, Skoda Fabia, Vauxhall Corsa, Ford Fiesta, Citroën C3 and Toyota Yaris. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best small cars. Best medium cars Before the meteoric rise of crossover SUVs, the conventional medium-sized hatchback was the go-to family car. They’re consummate all-rounders that aren’t difficult to drive or park, while also offering long-distance driving comfort and sufficient space and practicality for everyday family life. Buying a medium-sized car is one of the cheapest ways to get behind the wheel of a new model with a premium badge, although we’ve found plenty of examples in our annual survey where high-end marques have produced cheaper models that have turned out to be unreliable. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert Our lab tests show there's a vast difference between the best and the worst, though. Read our reviews to find a medium-sized car that scores well for fuel economy, interior quality and – critically – passenger safety. Popular models include the Volkswagen Golf, Vauxhall Astra, Mercedes A-Class, BMW 1 Series and Toyota Corolla. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best medium-sized cars. Best large cars As you’d expect, interior space in a large car shouldn't be an issue, and sizeable engines mean the extra weight won’t make for sluggish performance. But while you’d expect all ‘large’ cars to have plenty of passenger and luggage space, our lab tests show not all of them deliver on their promise. Unlike car manufacturers' own space claims, our expert tests measure only truly usable space to help you compare the cars on your shortlist. While once-popular large models from brands like Ford and Vauxhall are no longer available to buy new, there are still plenty of high-quality large cars from other brands. They also tend to be very well-equipped. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert We test to see how well each seat is padded, looking in depth at lumbar, thigh and head support, so you know whether a car will give you backache after a long drive or protect you from whiplash in the event of a rear-end collision. Popular large cars include the Toyota Prius, Tesla Model 3, BMW 3 Series and VW Passat. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best large cars. Best small SUVs and crossovers The best small SUVs have oodles of cabin space while being as easy to drive as smaller cars, and offer a commanding view of the road. To make sure visibility is good, we use a 360-degree rotating camera to measure exactly how much the driver can see, because huge door pillars and small rear windows can make parking a nightmare. Sensors, cameras and fully automated parking technology are increasingly common, but these extras shouldn’t come at the expense of a well-designed cabin. Don’t be wooed by some of the low-cost crossovers, because sometimes you really do get what you pay for. We’ve found Don’t Buy small SUVs that are light on in-car tech and safety equipment. Michael Passingham Which? cars expert You’ll also need to choose carefully to find a model that offers real practicality benefits over a regular hatchback. We accurately measure everything from head and legroom, through to usable boot space. Popular small SUVs and crossovers include the BMW X1, Hyundai Kona, Ford Puma, Nissan Juke and Kia Niro. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best small SUV and crossover cars. Best large SUVs and 4x4s They're typically big and spacious inside, but the interiors of large SUVs and 4x4s vary wildly. When determining the amount of interior space, we don’t just get in and stretch our legs – we use dummies to work out exactly how much head, leg and knee space each occupant will have. Sheer size doesn’t necessarily translate to great usability. Our tests have revealed models that can perform poorly in emergency manoeuvres and can sometimes be more hazardous in collisions with pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. Michael Passingham Which? cars expert Don’t forget to sit in all the seats when you buy an SUV; sometimes the back seats are more cramped than the front. This is particularly true of coupé-style SUVs, because the sloping roofs can significantly diminish rear headroom. So unless you're planning on rarely using the rear seats, spare a thought for your passengers and read our reviews before you make a shortlist. Popular models in the large SUV class include the Skoda Enyaq, BMW X5, Volvo XC90, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best large SUV and 4x4 cars. Best estate cars The best estates offer truly cavernous boots. Don’t get caught out by the manufacturers’ claims, though; some companies remove carpets and include the space designated for a spare tyre when measuring and reporting boot capacity. We use foam blocks to measure usable space, which give a more realistic figure as they ignore the small nooks that nothing practical can fit into. There’s more to consider than just a large boot. If an estate is high off the ground or has a raised loading lip between the boot sill and floor, it may be difficult to load, especially if you’re carting heavy items around. Also, think about which nice-to-haves you’d like, such as an automatic boot opener, interior lighting and cubbies for essentials. Popular estates include the VW Golf estate, Skoda Superb estate, Volvo V90 and BMW 5 Series Touring. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best estate cars. Best MPVs and people carriers They’re something of a dying breed, but there are still a number of great new MPVs available across a range of fuel types. The best offer decent boot space when all seats are occupied. As with other car classes, we check to see how well MPVs cope with an emergency hazard-avoidance manoeuvre. We swerve around objects at up to 56mph to make sure a car remains stable and controllable, even under extreme conditions. Our testing has found cars that can’t handle sharp turns at high speeds and can skid to the point where you’ve effectively lost control of the vehicle, which can lead to serious accidents. Some MPVs have sliding doors that can make it easier to get in and out, particularly in cramped parking spaces. However, we’ve found that some large MPVs have heavy sliding doors that some passengers may find difficult to open and close, or that can slide back on inclines, potentially posing a risk of injury. Popular people carriers include the Citroën C4 Picasso, Ford S-Max and Volkswagen Touran. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best MPVs. Best 7-seater cars Having lots of seats is all well and good, but if the car is cramped and hard to get into, those extra seats aren’t much use. The best 7-seaters have a sizable boot and won't be cramped, even when all the seats are in use. We also check to see how easy it is to enter any car, which can be a real consideration if you or a family member has mobility issues. If you have young children and need space for more than one child car seat, make sure you check which seats are suitable. Our reviews will highlight where car seats will and won’t fit, and we’ll also say where it’s possible to fit them side-by-side. Popular models available with seven seats include the BMW X7, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Touran and Ford S-Max. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best 7-seater cars. We test cars more thoroughly than anyone else Our tests go further than those carried out by other organisations and, because Which? is independent, you can trust our reviews to give you the full, honest and impartial truth about every car we test. Every car we review is subjected to more than 300 individual tests in a lab, on a test track and on real roads, allowing us to report accurate miles-per-gallon figures that you can rely on. We also include a motorway test – something that official tests don't cover. Testing in controlled lab conditions means the results we collect are directly comparable between different cars, helping us determine which models are better so you can find the perfect vehicle for your needs. And so you know which models are likely to prove reliable for years to come, we also gather feedback from thousands of UK car owners through the annual Which? car survey and use it to generate detailed reliability ratings for the cars we test.

November 2024 | Moritz Diethelm Kia feiert mit seinen E-Autos der EV-Serie weltweit Verkaufserfolge. Doch das war bislang kein billiges Vergnügen. Mit dem kompakten Alleskönner EV3 will Kia den Einstieg in die EV-Welt nun deutlich klar unter 40.000 Euro drücken. EFAHRER.com hat den EV3 einem ersten Test unterzogen. Artikel teilen Artikel teilen Artikel teilen In die Zwischenablage kopiert Fazit: Genialer Kompakt-Stromer zum guten Preis Der EV3 ist ein rundum gelungener Kompaktstromer, der mit futuristischem Design, gutem Raumangebot, praktischer Auslegung und guter Reichweite und günstigen elektrischen Verbräuchen glänzt. Besonders seine fair bepreiste Basisvariante ab rund 36.000 Euro verdient Anerkennung. Allerdings muss man beim Basismodell mit Frontantrieb, Lithium-Eisenphosphat-Akku und sparsamer Ausstattung auch kleinere Kompromisse eingehen. Schmankerl wie Allrad, eine GT-Sportvariante und 22 kW AC-Ladeleistung möchte Kia 2026 nachreichen. Das dürfte dann allerdings erheblich teurer werden. Anzeige Für wen ist der Kia EV3 das richtige Auto? Die Konkurrenz des EV3 ist knallhart. Der Basis-EV3 kostet rund 36.000 Euro, tritt etwa gegen Skodas noch etwas günstigeres Kompakt-SUV Elroq an. Der EV3 Long Range mit dem großen Akku spielt mit rund 48.000 Euro allerdings preislich gleich in der Liga von VW ID.4 und Tesla Model Y. Der EV3 spricht mit seiner praktischen Auslegung, seinem vergleichsweise erschwinglichen Basis-Preis und den guten Verbräuchen und Reichweiten Familien mit bis zu zwei, auch älteren Kindern an, die in der Verbrennerwelt etwa einen Passat gefahren wären. Gute Fahrdynamik und moderne Technik und Ausstattung machen ihn aber auch für junge Paare und Singles mit größerem Platzbedarf interessant. Kia EV3: Vorteile und Nachteile im Überblick Vorteile Gute Raumökonomie effizienter Antrieb High-Tech-Ausstattung möglich fairer Einstiegspreis Hoher Alltagsnutzen (Frunk, Anhängerkupplung, Dachträger) komfortables Fahrwerk Gute Verarbeitung Vehicle-to-X-fähig Nachteile Unterdurchschnittliche Ladeleistung Knapp bemessener LFP-Akku in der Basis Frontantrieb Anzeige Technische Daten: Kia EV3 Long Range Standard Range Motor Elektro Elektro Leistung 150 kW / 204 PS 150 kW / 204 PS Beschleunigung 0 – 100 km/h 10,6 Sekunden 7,6 Sekunden Höchstgeschwindigkeit 170 km/h 170 km/h Akkupaket 81,4 kWh 58,3 kWh Antrieb Front Front Reichweite 605 km 436 km Normverbrauch 14,9 kWh / 100 km 14,9 kWh / 100 km Ladevolumen 460 – 1.251 Liter 460 – 1.251 Liter Leergewicht 1.885 kg 1.800 kg Maße 4.300 x 1.850 x 1.560 mm 4.300 x 1.850 x 1.560 mm Preis ab 41.390 Euro ab 35.990 Euro Kia EV3: Warum ist dieser Koreaner fast unschlagbar? Außen wirkt der EV3 futuristisch und kantig, ist mit 4,30 Metern allerdings ein kompakter Crossover in der Größe zwischen dem Kia Niro und Soul, die er beerbt – den e-Niro hat Kia bereits vom Markt genommen. Trotz seiner kompakten Maße bietet der Kia EV3 ausreichend Platz für Fahrer und Passagiere. Die Rücksitze sind bequem, auch für Erwachsene, und bieten genügend Beinfreiheit. Mit einem Kofferraumvolumen von 460 Litern und einem zusätzlichen 25-Liter-Frunk (das ist der Kofferraum vorn, wo beim Verbrenner üblicherweise ein Motor ist) bietet der EV3 ausreichend Platz für den Alltag. Durch das Umklappen der Rücksitzlehnen lässt sich das Ladevolumen sogar auf bis zu 1.251 Liter erweitern. Anhängerkupplung und Dachträger machen den EV3 zum Alltagshelden. Seine Vorgänger sticht er damit klar aus, mit dem Skoda Elroq liegt er auf Augenhöhe. Kia EV3 Interieur: Innenraum und Verarbeitung Das Design des Innenraums ist minimalistisch. Die Materialien sind sinnvoll gewählt, wertig und gut verarbeitet. Das Cockpit präsentiert sich mit einer angenehmen Haptik dank genarbter und teilweise unterschäumter Kunststoffoberflächen. Die Topversion ""GT Line"" beeindruckt mit einem futuristischen Cockpit: Drei Bildschirme, die sich zu einer nahezu nahtlosen 30-Zoll-Einheit verbinden, dominieren das Interieur. Die Bedienung erfolgt intuitiv über das übersichtliche Menü, das auch ohne tiefgehende E-Auto-Expertise leicht zu durchschauen ist. Praktische analoge Bedienelemente für die Klimaanlage ergänzen die digitalen Schnittstellen. Zwischen den Vordersitzen mit Liegefunktion ist ein verstellbarer Tisch. Statt mit einem Schlüssel lässt sich der EV3 auch per Smartphone entsperren. Außerdem zeigt Kia eine Chat-GPT-Implementierung für die Sprachsteuerung, die sogar fahrkontextbezogen reagiert und etwa Tipps fürs Wetter, Routen, Restaurants und Lademöglichkeiten geben kann. Kia EV3: Fahrdynamik und Leistung Das Fahrwerk ist komfortabel abgestimmt und schluckt auch grobe Unebenheiten gut weg. Mit 204 PS an der Front ist der EV3 gut, aber im Konkurrenzumfeld nicht übertrieben motorisiert. Hier ist man souverän, aber ohne sportliche Ambition unterwegs. Seine Leistung bringt der EV3 im Fahrtest gut genug auf den trockenen Asphalt. Bei e-Niro und e-Soul war die Traktion noch ein großer Kritikpunkt. Die VW-Konzernautos mit ihrem Heckantrieb haben aber einen prinzipiellen Vorteil und sind auch für noch höhere Leistungen gerüstet. Die Assistenzsysteme funktionieren zuverlässig und sorgen für zusätzlichen Komfort und Sicherheit und erleichtern das Fahren in der Praxis. Serienmäßig ist eine navigationsbasierte Geschwindigkeitsregelanlage mit Stop-and-go-Funktion, Autobahnassistent, ein intelligenter Geschwindigkeitsassistent, Frontkollisionswarner 1.5 mit Fußgänger- und Radfahrererkennung sowie eine Abbiegefunktion, Spurhalte- und Spurfolgeassistent, Fernlichtassistent und ein Fahrerüberwachungssystem verbaut. Die Ansammlung von Warntönen nervt schnell, das Gebimmel lässt sich aber einfach per langem Druck auf die Lautstärketaste am Lenkrad abschalten oder mit ein paar Klicks im Menü individuell anpassen. Der Kia EV3 ist der erste Hyundai-Konzernwagen mit iPedal 3.0. Dieses System ermöglicht intelligentes Rekuperieren und One-Pedal-Driving mit drei Stufen plus Segelmodus. Das ist auf der kurzen Testfahrt etwas umständlich zu konfigurieren, ermöglicht dem Besitzer aber eine sehr genaue Anpassung der automatischen Rekuperation an Fahrervorlieben und Straßengegebenheiten. Viele E-Auto-Kunden wollen genau das, die Erfahrung zum Beispiel mit den aktuellen BMW-Elektroautos zeigt aber, dass eine intelligente, voll adaptive Rekuperationssteuerung ohne Konfigurationsmöglichkeiten in der Praxis mindestens ebenso gut und effizient arbeitet. Kia EV3: Reichweite und Verbrauch Zur Wahl stehen Akkus mit 58 kWh oder 81 kWh Kapazität. Die Basis kommt nur mit einfacheren LFP-Akkus. Die WLTP-Reichweite gibt Kia mit 410 bzw. 605 km an. Die angezeigten Stromverbräuche im Bordcomputer lagen bei unserer Testfahrt bei optimalen 20 Grad Außentemperatur und Landstraßengeschwindigkeiten mit unter 15 kWh pro 100 km meist spielend leicht auf dem Niveau der Herstellerangaben. Wie der EV3 auf der Langstrecke und bei Autobahngeschwindigkeiten mit dem Strom auskommt, muss der EFAHRER-Volltest zeigen. Kia EV3 Schnellladen: Ohne 800-Volt-Turbo langsamer als die VW-Konkurrenz Laden geht nicht mit den irren Geschwindigkeiten von EV6 und EV9 – weil dem EV3 die 800-Volt-Technik der großen Brüder fehlt. Mit maximal 100 kW und einer halben Stunde Ladedauer für das Laden von 10 auf 80 Prozent hält das Basismodell mit den Basis-VWs mit. Der 81-kWh-Akku verdaut maximal 128 kW und liegt damit spürbar schlechter als die 77-kWh-Varianten des deutschen Konkurrenten: Die laden mit bis zu 175 kW. Wie die VWs ist der EV3 vorbereitet für Vehicle-to-X, kann wie eine große Powerbank seinen Strom also auch ans Netz, ans Haus oder einen Stromverbraucher abgeben. Ein ganzes Haus auf diese Art zu versorgen ist zwar noch Zukunftsmusik, per einfachem Adapter aber eine vollwertige 230-Volt-Steckdose dabeizuhaben, ist zum Beispiel fürs Camping richtig cool. An einer privaten Wallbox lädt die große Batterie in etwa 7 Stunden und 15 Minuten vollständig auf, die kleine in rund 5 Stunden und 20 Minuten - beide aktuell nur mit 11 kW. Eine 22-kW-Option, die vor allem das Laden an öffentlichen Wechselstrom-Ladesäulen beschleunigt, will Kia 2026 anbieten.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a detailed review of the Kia EV3, touching on various aspects such as design, pricing, features, and technical specifications.

The lack of pistons and noisy combustion means electric cars can ghost along very quietly at city speeds, and they tend to be very nippy. The surprising turn of speed from a standstill can take the uninitiated by surprise, so make sure you take it slowly the first few times you drive one. The lack of noise can seem peculiar at first, as can be the total absence of engine vibration, but these are two big advantages of driving an electric car. The basics of driving an electric car are the same as any other car. There's still an accelerator and a brake pedal. But in other ways an electric car can seem strange to a seasoned driver. Some models, including the Nissan Leaf, can be driven using just one pedal. So when you lift off the accelerator, the car uses heavy regenerative braking to slow down the car significantly (enough to illuminate the brake lights) and feed energy back into the battery. It can take a little time to get used to and there's still a separate brake if you'd prefer to drive conventionally. How should you charge an electric car? Unless you don't use your car that often, don't even think about using a domestic three-pin socket to charge your car. This is slow. Very slow. We're talking in excess of 35 hours' worth of slow, depending on the car. For regular charging at home, if your property allows it, you'll be best off investing in a dedicated fast charger. This normally takes the form of a wallbox mounted on the outside of your house. The type of charger, connector and wattage you need will depend on your car, budget and what electricity connection you have. When you're away from home, you can use websites or apps to find out where your nearest public charging point is. These include on-street charging points in city centres, for example, as well as the growing number of high-voltage fast chargers and rapid chargers at strategic service stations on the motorway network. Currently, charging points are run by a variety of separate networks, so you’ll need to work out which ones are compatible with your car, and register with them accordingly. And bear in mind that some public charging points can be very costly when compared with rates for home charging. See our dedicated guide on how much it costs to charge an electric car for all you need to know. Which electric cars have the longest range? If you're planning to buy an electric car, check the maximum range of the electric cars in your shortlist, especially if you regularly drive long distances. And don't forget to factor in your charging time, too, if you need to top up at any time other than overnight. The maximum driving range available can vary greatly between models. Luxury models with larger batteries offer greater claimed driving ranges, but even entry-level models should offer a driving range of around 150-250 miles. However, don't just look at the official figures. At Which? we do our own realistic range tests because, just like fuel tests, the figure manufacturers quote are often quite ambitious. We've found cars that fall more than 100 miles short of their quoted range. If you don't want to be caught out, make sure you check out the real, independently tested ranges in our electric car reviews.

Carmakers are scrambling to up their zero-emission sales to comply with increasingly tightening Net Zero laws. 1 Brand are trying to boost EV sales by offering huge discounts Credit: Getty The new Government has confirmed it will reinstate the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 after former PM Rishi Sunak delayed it to 2025. Plenty of firms have already self-imposed earlier deadlines to make the all-electric transition in an attempt to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, Jaguar won't sell a new car in the UK for a whole year as bosses prepare to phase out petrol power altogether in 2026. But every brand is still subject to the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. The legally-binding regulations force manufacturers to ensure that a certain portion of their sales are electric vehicles, with the percentage increasing each year up to the total ban. This year's requirement is 22%, with firms fined up to £1,500 per car they produce over the limit. Already, bosses at Ford have said they will have to make fewer petrol models to balance their stats. However, others are trying to get the EVs flying out the doors by slapping them with heavy discounts. DS, the luxury arm of Citroen, is leading the way, with an average drop of 35.7% on the 3 Crossback. That means that new models are cut from over £37,000 to under £25,000, according to data from AutoTrader. Terrifying moment £50k EV explodes on family's driveway before flames spread to their home MG isn't far behind with a 34% dip for the 5 and 30% for the ZS. Even Tesla, which isn't bound by the Mandate since it only makes EVs, has dropped the Model 3 from £42,000 to £39,000 in the past year. Ian Plummer, commercial director at AutoTrader, commented: ""That sort of discount finally makes it possible for the consumer to make a rational decision to buy an EV, rather than base it on emotional reasons such as environmental factors. ""It’s going to be very painful [for manufacturers]. ""They are going to be selling EVs at a loss in many cases and they will have to arbitrage those losses with the profits they can still make on their diesel and petrol vehicles."" The only issue is that EVs remain stubbornly more expensive on average than their petrol counterparts, despite the discounts. This is largely to do with the costs associated with developing brand new electric platforms, rather than re-using already established internal combustion specs. As a result, brands can only cut prices so much to stimulate demand before losses become unsustainable. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry body the SMMT, explained: ""The ZEV mandate compels manufacturers to produce, but it does not compel consumers to buy.""",Business,bing,"The article primarily discusses the current market trend of reduced prices for electric vehicles (EVs) in the UK due to regulatory pressures and a drive to increase zero-emission sales.

Mini Cooper Electric review,"Perhaps even harder to believe that the renaissance car is on its fourth generation already, this arguably its most significant upgrade in those years. As a generous treat for electric Mini ...",https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/mini/cooper-electric,,2024-11-08 00:00:00,Top Gear,,"Hard to believe that it's been over 20 years since the new Mini arrived. Perhaps even harder to believe that the renaissance car is on its fourth generation already, this arguably its most significant upgrade in those years. As a generous treat for electric Mini customers, this version is on a new platform, while the petrol one is a heavily reworked version of the old car with similar styling. As has become the norm in the last two decades, the newest Mini is a bit bigger than before (it’s taller and wider but not quite as long), the new Countryman SUV is even bigger and that’s created space for the Aceman small SUV, which might end up jostling with the Cooper for sales. Advertisement - Page continues below Three versions of the Cooper Electric are available: the 181bhp Cooper E (from £30,000), 215bhp SE (from £34,500) and 255bhp John Cooper Works (from £39k). It's up against stuff like the Renault 5, Peugeot e-208, Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500. Not so mini anymore, is it? Which is what everyone will say for the first three months of you driving this around. But then none of the Minis built this century have been particularly petite, and indeed none of them have sought to replicate the revolutionary tiny nature of the original. You can’t help feeling nostalgic though, so the new Cooper scratches the itch in some inventive ways while still being fully future-focused. Few cars were as analogue as the original Issigonis-designed Mini, or as ingeniously packaged. Its immense character was in inverse proportion to its diminutive size, but its creator, Sir Alec Issigonis, was ruthless when it came to weight saving. Advertisement - Page continues below BEV porkiness is such an issue that soon our multi-storey car parks will be wilting under the extra pressure. At 1,600kg, the new Mini Cooper Electric is kinda chunky, but it’s actually shorter than the outgoing car, with minimal front and rear overhangs. It’s 3.8m long overall. It does look good though. Design director Oliver Heilmer and his team have instigated a clever evolution of the Mini’s visual language, while preserving its wheel-at-each-corner stance™. The body, window area and floating roof are distinct yet coherent elements (see also that other British ‘icon’, the Range Rover), and the nose receives a new octagonal treatment. The circular headlamps now come with three different light signatures, and the rear lights’ jingoistic union jack motif can be switched out. The whole lot does a welcome and farewell fandango when the car senses the key (or smartphone) as you approach. It's all trying very hard, you'll either love it or hate it. Inside, the car continues to pay tribute to the original while simultaneously being an absolute tech-fest. It’s mostly quite minimalist, with flat air vents, fun use of materials around the dash and handy storage, but the interior is dominated by the slightly crazy 9.4in central circular touchscreen. The sharp OLED number actually works well, bringing character to the car along with a whole heap of, er, complication. See the Interior tab for more. How does it drive? The handling is sharp and enthusiastic, so you can chuck it about with confidence. But the ride is too firm. And you can’t escape the weight of the car, either: BMW Group is generally quite good at disguising heft, but there’s no substitute for just being light in the first place. I need range and performance stats, stat! Time to get sensible. The lower-powered E models (181bhp/214lb ft, 7.3 seconds 0–62mph) come with a 36.6kWh battery that’s officially rated for up to 185 miles of range. That’ll probably come out at around 150 miles in the real world, and is better if you mostly keep to town driving. The more powerful SE (215bhp/243lb ft, 6.7s) gets a larger 49.2kWh battery that’s good for up to 247 miles WLTP; think 210/220 in practice. Strangely, the quicker John Cooper Works (255bhp/258lb ft, 5.9s) is rated up to 250 miles, presumably because its aero stick-ons help with efficiency. Our choice from the range MINI 160kW SE Classic 54kWh 3dr Auto £34,445 See prices and specs What's the verdict? “ The Cooper Electric is firm-riding, but has the handling smarts and eager reactions to make this a trade-off worth tolerating ” Fundamentally, this is a great little car, overflowing with personality. This one just happens to be electric. The Cooper Electric is firm-riding, as so many EVs are, but has the handling smarts and eager reactions to make this a trade-off worth tolerating. The interior tech is occasionally infuriating, but mostly clever and well judged. Need a bit more practicality?

The compact model will be available with front-wheel and all-wheel drive from 2025.,https://www.heise.de/en/news/Electric-car-presentation-Suzuki-e-Vitara-with-all-wheel-drive-on-request-10003487.html,,2024-11-04 19:52:00,heise online,,"Anzeige Suzuki is venturing into the highly competitive electric B-segment with the e-Vitara. The 4.27 m long, 1.63 m high and 1.80 m wide crossover is produced on a new technical basis in India and is available with either a 49 or 61 kWh battery. Its special feature is the option of all-wheel drive with off-road functions. Suzuki's first electric car To date, Suzuki has had only one model that can also cover a significant distance electrically, apart from mild hybrid drives with the plug-in hybrid Across. However, this is a makeshift solution to save fleet consumption, which is only possible thanks to badge engineering with partner Toyota. The Across is actually a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (test) with an electric WLTP range of 75 km. With the e-Vitara, on the other hand, which rolls off the production line at Suzuki's Gujarat plant in India and is due to be launched in Germany next summer, Suzuki is launching its first own electric car. Bild 1 von 8 Suzuki e-Vitara I (8 Bilder) Ganz offensichtlich ist Suzuki daran gelegen, den e-Vitara auch in der Darstellung als geländegängig zu charakterisieren. (Bild: Suzuki ) The e-Vitara is based on the angular appearance that the Suzuki EVX Concept study already hinted at. The interior of the production vehicle is also not quite as futuristic as the concept car. Piano lacquer and leather upholstery cater to more bourgeois tastes and thanks to the wheelbase of at least 2.70 m, there is apparently also sufficient space in the rear. All-wheel drive model with off-road program The instrument and control screens are combined into a single unit, and the driving modes are selected using a rotary knob. Surrounding this button are the buttons for the driving modes, hill start and hill descent assistance and trail mode, a traction assistance program for loose surfaces such as snow or gravel.

(Bild: Suzuki ) Suzuki is introducing its battery-electric ""Heartect-e"" platform with the e-Vitara. The drive is provided by ""electric axles"" (e-axles), each of which combines an electric motor and inverter in one housing. Two lithium iron phosphate batteries with 49 and 61 kWh are available and the cell chemistry alone means that Suzuki will install a battery preconditioning system. The importer does not yet know exactly what this will be able to do, nor does it know the values for charging performance and duration of the two batteries. This is because the homologation process is still underway, as Suzuki Germany said in response to our inquiry. In conjunction with the 49 kWh battery, only a front-wheel drive with 106 kW and a torque of 189 Nm is available. If you choose the 61 kWh battery, you have the choice between front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive ""Allgrip-e"". With front-wheel drive, 128 kW and also 189 Nm are available, while with all-wheel drive there is an additional motor on the rear axle with 48 kW, resulting in a system output of 135 kW and a maximum torque of 300 Nm. With the small battery, the electric car weighs at least 1.7 tons, with the large battery 1.8 and with all-wheel drive 1.9.

(Image credit: Kia) Riding on the same platform as the EV6 and the sister company’s Hyundai Ioniq 5, but offering either 58.3kWh or the larger 81.4kWh battery packs, the EV3 is almost 400mm shorter than the recently-refreshed EV6. But you wouldn’t know it. Decked out in a sharp white and black hue, the test car I drove around the bustling streets of Seoul had more than a hint of Stormtrooper about it. Where some families might find the EV6 a little claustrophobic inside, with the swooping roofline impeding taller drivers and occupants, the EV3 is positively cavernous. It’s also dripping with technology, offers some of the best efficiency of any electric vehicle on sale today and impresses with its laid-back, easy-to-live-with demeanor. The electric vehicle market has been desperately seeking that ‘catch-all’ car that could one day gain the notoriety of Volkswagen’s Golf and Ford’s best-selling Fiesta in Europe, or the likes of Honda’s CR-V and Toyota’s Rav 4 in North America. The EV3 could well be that car. A stylish SUV (Image credit: Future) Karim Habib, Kia’s head of global design, has helped propel the brand into more luxurious territory with his team’s approach to exterior styling. Love it or hate it, the EV6 turned heads when it first arrived on the scene and the massive EV9 cuts an imposing figure on the road today.

Despite being smaller than the EV6, it still feels like a large car, with enough futuristic design touches (check out the front and rear light signature and squared-off wheel arches) to have pedestrians double-taking. Decked out in a sharp white and black hue, the test car I drove around the bustling streets of Seoul had more than a hint of Stormtrooper about it, with its sharp exterior lines ensuring it stood out among a crowd of swooping South Korean saloons. (Image credit: Kia) Inside, there’s a clever use of cloth (made from recycled plastics) that covers most of the dash, while the central extendable wood effect arm rest acts as a place to rest a laptop (so you can work while charging) or a taco tray (so you can eat while charging). There’s plentiful head and legroom for all, the trunk or boot is massive, and there’s extra stowage space in the ‘frunk’. Better still, the seats are beyond comfortable, with adjustable and cushioned headrests pinched from the EV9 that beat most pillows for plushness. Unlike the EV6, which can feel a little gloomy inside, the EV3 is light, airy and welcoming, making it great for those with young kids. It’s easy to swivel around in the front seats and chat to those in back. A full length panoramic sunroof would improve the airiness even further but it’s a nice place to be. Screen time (Image credit: Kia) Kia isn’t shy about the technology it offers as standard on the EV3, with the infotainment system comprising two 12.3-inch displays, as well as a smaller 5.3-inch panel sandwiched in-between the two that takes care of air conditioning. It is all very clever stuff that’s largely very simple to use, while physical buttons remain so the screen-prodding is kept to a minimum. It’s a mammoth digital offering, although the climate control panel is annoyingly located just behind the steering wheel, making it difficult to see and interact with. Spend a bit extra and the cars come with a crisp head-up display, while the constantly-connected nature of the vehicle results in smart mapping and routing, as well as a suite of downloadable apps, such as YouTube. There’s also the full gamut of Hyundai’s latest digital assistant, which uses generative AI to communicate and answer questions in natural language. It can control most of the functionality within the vehicle, but is also open to wider questions and queries. It works well. Even the interior lighting is clever, with the ability to change the hue to suit a mood. During the test drive, I noticed it flashed red when it detected that I was traveling above the speed limit (sorry, officer). (Image credit: Kia) The smart adaptive cruise control is intuitive and very easy to use, even automatically adapting your speed if it detects average speed road sections and it is able to autonomously change lanes with a flick of the indicator stalk. It is all very clever stuff that’s largely very simple to use, while physical buttons remain so the screen-prodding is kept to a minimum. Above all else, the tech (and interior as a whole) feels approachable and not as shouty as other brands. Kia wanted to create a luxury home decor ambience and it has paid off. The front seats even feature a one-button, fully-reclined mode to assist with catching some zeds while charging. You can’t get any more laid back and homely than that. A premium EV experience (Image credit: Kia) The EV3 won’t blow any minds with its driving performance, but that’s not its intention. The 150kW/204hp motor found across the entire range is capable of propelling the car from a standstill to 62mph in 7.5 seconds, which is plenty enough for most, but tame compared to other EVs. Similarly, the steering is light and a breeze to use around town and the driving dynamics lend themselves to daily use, rather than thrill-seeking on country lanes. Perhaps more importantly, the electric range of 372 miles in the larger battery option (267 miles in the 58kWh variant) is decent enough for lengthy road trips. The max charging speed is 128kW for the larger battery, meaning a 20-80 per cent top-up will take around 30 minutes from a fast charger. That's down somewhat on rivals, but still fast enough to make big distances possible. The Hyundai Motor Group in general has some of the most efficient EVs on sale today and the Kia EV3 is no different. The range that’s offered up by the infotainment system is pretty much spot on and the built-in routing will assist by delivering live charging availability and route options that incorporate the required charging stops. (Image credit: Kia) Granted, the EV3 isn’t the ultra-affordable compact car some sectors of the buying public have been demanding, but it isn’t designed to hit that brief. Hyundai has the Inster to fill that void and Kia has promised its smallest most affordable vehicle in the EV2, which is due in 2026. Instead, the EV3 is a great middle-ground, affording plenty of space and tons of tech, while substantially undercutting a Kia EV6 with similar power output and overall range. It’s excellent and Kia has seemingly done it again with another hit EV. It makes you wonder if it’s worth spending more in the EV5, which is on sale in Australia now but will be released elsewhere next year.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a detailed review of the Kia EV3, offering insights into its features, design, and technology, which may be new to readers unfamiliar with this specific model.

Adding battery power into the company's most popular model, the Macan, feels like a natural progression of the company's EV plans. We've already driven the range-topping Macan Electric Turbo, but now we've also experienced the basic model in the family, the entry-level Macan Electric RWD, testing it out in southern Germany. Happily, the slowest Macan EV stays true to its Porsche roots, even if the powertrain doesn't knock your socks off. Our expert editors test every vehicle we review. Read more about how we test and review cars here. Rocky Photograph The Lowdown The Macan Electric range is building to the point where it will completely replace the previous-generation internal combustion Macan, which is still being sold alongside it. The entry-level, rear-wheel-drive Macan Electric is being added to the lineup for the 2025 model year beneath the 4, 4S and Turbo. While lacking the traction of all-wheel drive, the RWD version offers a more affordable path to Macan Electric ownership — but it is still more than $12,000 pricier than the base ICE version. Vehicle Tested: 2025 Porsche Macan Electric 2025 Porsche Macan Electric Base Price: $77,295 $77,295 Price as tested: $TBA $TBA Location: Stuttgart, Germany More Specs Powertrain: single motor, rear-wheel drive Power: 355 hp Torque: 415 lb-ft 0-60 mph: 5.2 seconds Battery capacity: 95.0 kWh Weight: 5300 pounds EPA range: TBC How Does It Drive? View Full Gallery Rocky Photograph With the introduction of a base model to the Macan Electric lineup, the delta in performance between the bottom end and the top of the line has become staggering. While the rear-driver makes a healthy 355 horsepower, the Turbo makes 576 hp. That said, their range numbers only differ marginally, with the RWD claiming 315 miles and the Turbo 288. All Macan Electric models are powered by the same 100-kWh battery and built on the VW Group's relatively new Premium Electric platform. The result of this shared heritage is that driving differences are felt primarily in the power delivery. The base Macan Electric definitely feels like a poor relation compared to its more potent siblings, despite its headline power figure and ability to deliver 415 lb-ft of peak torque. The RWD lacks the ability to push its driver forcefully back into the seat during a hard launch, a sensation you might reasonably expect any electric Porsche to deliver. This could partially be due to a taller ratio for its single-speed transmission versus the rest of the range, one that improves efficiency but also contributes to an official 5.4-second 0-to-60-mph time. That just isn't quick by modern EV standards. Despite that, Porsche deserves praise for the linearity of its accelerator response, feeding power to the rear wheels in seemingly perfect correlation to the pedal position — an attribute that definitely isn't shared with all electric competitors. It'll chirp its rear tires under hard acceleration from standstill but only with the traction control turned off. View Full Gallery Rocky Photograph The Macan EV might be the slowest of the company's electric cars, but its Porsche-born attributes are readily apparent. The steering is well-weighted for every speed, surface, and drive mode. Turn-in is rapid, and the responses linear. Even on a derestricted section of German autobahn, the front end felt unaffected by lift as speeds rose well beyond what would have been legal in the U.S. With a drag coefficient of 0.25 and self-leveling active air suspension (standard on all Macan Electric variants in the States), the RWD Macan felt entirely comfortable doing big velocities. The addition of rear-wheel steering on my test car (set to be a $2030 option) enhanced agility even further, both in low-speed maneuvering and in tight corners. The braking system works well at combining regeneration and friction seamlessly. Porsche doesn't offer a one-pedal drive mode, nor does it allow much adjustment of regeneration levels, but the company's engineers have done a fine job in making it feel natural. The brakes in my test car possessed the linear pedal feel and forceful bite that Porsche is known for. What's It Like To Live With? STUDIO GOICO The Macan Electric's cabin feels like a substantial upgrade over that of its gasoline-powered sibling, which is no surprise, given the ICE version is a heavy facelift of a car that was launched a decade ago. The new car has more technology and an improved sense of solidity, which is apparent even when doing something as simple as operating a window switch. The Macan RWD might be the entry-level model, but buyers still have myriad choices when it comes to trim colors and extra equipment — although indulging in many of them will quickly move the RWD well beyond the base price of its quicker siblings. Even if you don't tick a single box, it's a classy, well-finished place to be. Two screens come as standard: a 12.6-inch digital gauge cluster and a 10.9-inch infotainment touchscreen in the center of the dashboard. It's also possible to add another 10.9-inch screen as a display for the front passenger (a $1570 option) and an augmented-reality head-up display for an extra $2530. The user interface features swift responses, crisp graphics, and intuitive menu construction, but I loved the passenger's screen's ability to control music and navigation, transferring such duties to the non-driving partner. Climate control is managed by a panel that combines a digital display with analog control switches, the best of both worlds in terms of usability. And you've got to love an EV that still gives features a volume knob rather than just a touch-sensitive panel. My only real complaint was with the more intrusive elements of the ADAS assistance systems on my Euro-spec test car, with an incessant alert whenever a speed limit was broken — and this reset every time the car was turned on. Steering intervention for the lane-keeping function felt abrupt as well. Fingers crossed that U.S.-spec cars will be spared quite so much nannying. Finally, I found the seats in the Macan Electric to be agreeable but not particularly comfortable over longer periods of driving, though the adjustable bolstering was welcomed. Should I Buy One? View Full Gallery Rocky Photograph Even the most basic Macan Electric feels like a true Porsche, from its dynamic responses to the tightness of its fit and finish. But although this 5000-pound crossover is impressively nimble for what it is, it also lacks the engagement that comes as standard with the gasoline Macan in terms of noise — or even the simple pleasure of paddle-shifting a PDK transmission. The RWD version significantly broadens the appeal of the Macan Electric range, being priced close enough to rivals to trigger defections for those who are willing to sacrifice performance (and driven-wheel count) for a Porsche badge and driving experience. It's not the most exciting Macan Electric, but the rear-wheel-drive version is likely the easiest for potential buyers to justify. Highlights and Lowlights We Love: The quick, well-weighted steering system, no matter if rear-wheel steering is fitted. Modern, well-designed infotainment system paired with a passenger's screen. The ability to match seat belts to paint color, for a price. We Don't Love: It's slow for a top-end EV The silent powertrain lacks the character of its combustion sister Way too much ADAS intervention (on the European version) Favorite Detail: My initial queasy impressions of Porsche's augmented-reality display were based on an uneasy disconnect between my eyes and brain, but reading the moving, active heads-up display became routine after half an hour or so. The distance-centered directions were particularly helpful while driving in an unfamiliar country.

What Would Elon Musk’s Tesla Gain—and Lose—From a Trump Presidency?,This issue is preventing our website from loading properly.

I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly .” In the past, Trump has been openly opposed to EVs and federal support for the industry and incentives, saying he would roll back supportive policies such as the tax credit program for EV purchases of up to $7,500 for new cars. That program has been in place since 2008 as part of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act under President George W. Bush; the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 modified and extended this credit. When Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, endorsed former President Donald Trump, financially supported his reelection campaign, and even attended rallies in swing states, he upended a lot of the politics around electric vehicles (EVs). It used to be quite an easy distinction to make: Climate-conscious Democrats would buy EVs and Democratic Party policies supported EV uptake, while Republicans were against EVs. (As recently as 2023, a Gallup poll found that about 71 percent of Republicans would not consider buying an EV , compared with 17 percent of Democrats.) However, the political landscape and rhetoric around EVs is beginning to shift.

(As recently as 2023, a Gallup poll found that about 71 percent of Republicans would not consider buying an EV, compared with 17 percent of Democrats.) However, the political landscape and rhetoric around EVs is beginning to shift. Since Musk’s endorsement, Trump has softened his tone, stating, “I’m for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.” In the past, Trump has been openly opposed to EVs and federal support for the industry and incentives, saying he would roll back supportive policies such as the tax credit program for EV purchases of up to $7,500 for new cars. That program has been in place since 2008 as part of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act under President George W. Bush; the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 modified and extended this credit. Musk has repeatedly stated he is anti-subsidies, though Tesla has received $2.8 billion in state and federal government subsidies in the form of grants and tax credits since it delivered its first car in 2008. Tesla also earned nearly $9 billion from carbon credit sales since 2009, trading these regulatory credits to other automakers that need to comply with emissions standards set by regulators. Despite its strong position as the American EV industry leader—Tesla’s U.S. market share in the third quarter of 2024 was 48 percent, followed by General Motors with 9.3 percent and Ford with 8.6 percent—removing federal incentives for EVs would still impact Tesla’s sales, especially among price-sensitive consumers. EV adoption will remain reliant on subsidies to bridge the cost gap with conventional vehicles. In fact, there is direct evidence from Europe that removing the incentives for consumers too early, before the market is developed, will result in a drop in EV purchases. Because of federal budget constraints, Germany cut the national EV subsidy in December 2023, and sales numbers keep dropping: by 37 percent in July 2024 and 69 percent in August. Most other U.S. manufacturers, such as Ford, GM, and Rivian (which received an investment of up to $5 billion from German carmaker Volkswagen), would likely face significantly tougher challenges in maintaining their EV offerings without such incentives. But even industry leader Tesla would not be immune to these policy changes. If you were looking to crush Tesla’s competition through federal action, first on the chopping block would be policies put in place by the Biden administration to support established automotive component manufacturers to shift to EVs. During a visit to Detroit in May 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris announced an investment for a $100 million fund for small- and medium-size component manufacturers to upgrade facilities that can then produce components needed for EVs. (Most of the smaller suppliers only have production facilities for internal combustion engine vehicles.) More importantly, there is a new $2 billion Domestic Automotive Manufacturing Conversion Grants program from the U.S. Department of Energy for domestic automotive manufacturing in areas such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other swing states. This will be at risk of shutting down if those factories cannot make that transition to EV manufacturing. The fund is meant to support those small manufacturers and their workers and will run from this year through September 2031. Trump has vowed on day one to remove the so-called EV mandate, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean car emissions standards and the Biden administration’s goal that half of new car sales be electric by 2030. While these measures are not legally binding, removing emissions standards would have negative effects on EV development, because investment uncertainty would result, EV production by established automakers would slow down, and consumers would receive the signal to keep buying gas cars. If Trump gets reelected, he has agreed to let Musk take on a government advisory role. When he unveiled his economic plans in September, Trump also announced the creation of a government efficiency commission that Musk would head. This equates to many potential conflicts of interest as Musk’s companies—Tesla, and also and SpaceX—are involved in at least 20 recent investigations or reviews from various U.S. government departments and various U.S. agencies, including the departments of transportation, justice, labor, and interior. Apart from issues that would potentially distort domestic competition, the other factor at play is the competition from Chinese EV makers such as BYD, which already outsold Tesla in the final quarter of 2023, 526,000 to 484,000. There is a 100 percent tariff on Chinese EVs coming into the United States, introduced by the Biden administration in May 2024, and Trump would no doubt keep up these tariffs to keep BYD out of the U.S. market. There is a good chance Trump will even increase them, as there is a bipartisan agreement that domestic industries and the U.S. battery industry need to be protected. By contrast, Musk criticized the tariffs on Chinese EVs (“I’m in favor of no tariffs,” he said at a conference) when they were introduced, advocating instead for free markets with minimal government interference. Both Democrats’ and Republicans’ China policy would keep out Chinese EV manufacturing from the United States. This is in contrast to what is happening in Europe—where BYD is building a production plant in Hungary to avoid European Union tariffs. China would probably retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on imports, and China is Tesla’s second-largest market. As Beijing fosters and grows its own EV industry, Tesla could face barriers to expanding there if United States-China relations worsen, potentially losing even more ground to Chinese EV companies such as BYD or Xiaomi. A return to aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods under a Trump administration could impede not only sales but also Tesla’s supply chain, as many of its components and raw materials such as batteries are sourced or refined in China. Nearly 40 percent of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla’s batteries are Chinese companies. Higher tariffs on battery components from China would force Tesla to pass on costs to consumers or cut into profit margins. EU countries are already preparing for a high-stakes trade war with Trump if he wins a second term. The EU is likely to respond strongly to Trump’s announcement of a universal 20 percent tariff, as such tariffs would hurt some of Europe’s largest companies, including carmakers. Trump already threated to impose tariffs on EU auto exports during his first presidency. In retaliation, the EU would impose tariffs on American goods, potentially targeting key U.S. industries or sectors including companies that are gaining ground in Europe’s EV market, such as Tesla. If the EU enacted counter-tariffs on United States-based automakers, Tesla could face increased costs or restrictions when selling vehicles in the EU. Retaliatory tariffs could complicate Tesla’s European supply chain, increasing production costs or delaying expansions in key markets, including the expansion of Tesla’s Gigafactory in Germany. In a scenario where the EU shifts incentives to favor local manufacturers, Tesla’s European growth strategy could be directly affected, posing challenges to its long-term market positioning. For these reasons, a Trump presidency might not be a slam dunk for Tesla. Two of Musk’s other businesses, SpaceX and Starlink, maintain critical government partnerships, with SpaceX, in particular, becoming integral to U.S. national security and space exploration. But while the impact of a second Trump term on these critical technologies is unclear, it would almost certainly weaken federal support for EVs, potentially slowing market growth and infrastructure expansion critical for their rapid uptake—all of which is urgently needed to reduce transport emissions and mitigate climate change.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article primarily focuses on the potential impacts of a Trump presidency on Tesla and the broader EV market, framed within the political landscape.

Tesla, despite its strong market share, has benefited from subsidies and could suffer sales declines if such incentives are removed. European examples show that curtailing benefits too early can significantly reduce sales. Trump's proposed removal of emissions standards and the EV sales goal could also hinder EV development, as it would create uncertainty and slow production. Additionally, potential tariffs on Chinese EV manufacturers and components might affect Tesla's supply chain, increasing costs.

Going electric introduces a whole new ...",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-set-up-home-charging-electric-car-ev,,2024-10-30 19:42:00,Business Insider,,"Advertisement To get the most out of your electric car, you'll want to charge it at home, and likely overnight. Home charging can take only a few hours and is healthier for your battery than fast charging. This article is part of ""Getting Ready for Electric,"" a series of guides and practical advice for buying your next EV. Filling up a car with gas is second nature for nearly anyone with a driver's license. But charging an electric vehicle? For many, that's a brand-new world. Going electric introduces a whole new element of car ownership: charging. We spoke with experts at the automotive marketplace Cars.com and the charger installer Qmerit to demystify the process and learn best practices. Advertisement What are the benefits of charging at home? If you have a fast-charging station nearby or a plug available at your workplace, you may be able to get by without charging at home. But Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com and an EV owner herself, argued that charging at home makes EV ownership convenient and worthwhile. ""Home charging is what makes it easy and efficient to own an EV,"" Newman said. ""That's the bottom line."" With the right kind of at-home charger, owners can recharge their cars in a matter of hours. They can plug them in overnight, for example, and wake up with 250 or 300 miles of driving range. This slower charging is also healthier for your car's battery over the long term — and depending on your utility rates, it could be much cheaper. Advertisement EnergySage estimates that charging an EV costs about $0.05 per mile of range added, though that depends on things like location, electricity rates, and the type of EV charger used. DC fast chargers, like Superchargers, can cost up to $0.60 per kWh, depending on congestion. At home, kWh prices tend to be much lower, depending on your local utility and how it sources energy production. How do I get set up to charge at home? Most electric cars come with a Level 1 charging cord. This cord plugs into a standard 110-volt alternating-current household outlet and slowly adds a few miles of driving range an hour. But Newman said sluggish charging speeds may be tough to live with on a daily basis, even if you can plug in for a full night. EV owners and experts recommend charging your EV at home for convenience and savings. UCG Level 2 charging, which she recommends, uses a higher-voltage connection to add more range per hour. These plugs can be found at public charging stations, and homeowners can install them in a garage or driveway. Some EVs also come with these chargers in addition to a Level 1 plug. Advertisement Level 2 chargers can be plugged into a 240-volt socket — like what you may use for an appliance like a dryer — or hardwired into a home's electrical panel. Either way, Newman recommends consulting an electrician who specializes in charger installations to get a handle on the expected costs and work involved. How much does it cost to set up my home for charging? The cost of a home-charging setup varies widely. If you already have a 240-volt outlet in a convenient spot, you may be able to simply buy a charger and plug it in. Level 2 chargers can cost $250 to $750. Otherwise, you could need more extensive — and expensive — work. Ken Sapp, a senior vice president at Qmerit, said most of its jobs cost $1,600 or less, including permits but excluding the cost of the charger itself. Sapp added that projects involve tapping into an existing 240-volt circuit (or adding one) and installing the charger or a dedicated outlet in a convenient location, like the wall of a garage. Advertisement The farther your electrical panel is from where you'd like to plug in, the pricier installation will be, Sapp said. (Ideally your panel is on the same wall as your charger, but if wiring needs to be routed up from a basement, for example, things get trickier.) Moreover, Sapp said, some homes may need to upgrade their electrical panel to handle the extra load from charging, which could increase costs by thousands of dollars. A Level 2 home charger can charge an EV in a matter of hours. ChargePoint When Cars.com installed home chargers for six of its car reviewers in 2022, the costs varied widely. One installation totaled about $1,700. Another required a service upgrade and trenching to route a circuit across a yard to a detached garage, costing nearly $7,000. To make everything a bit easier on your wallet, you can take advantage of a federal tax credit that covers 30% of charger-installation costs up to $1,000. Utilities commonly offer rebates or special electricity rates for EV owners, too. Advertisement When it comes to choosing a charger, Sapp says it's a ""safe bet"" to go with a model recommended by your car's manufacturer. Newman says the right charger depends on what your home can handle and what's best for your specific vehicle. An experienced electrician can help make that decision. ""We don't have to be experts in everything,"" she said. ""It's OK to rely on a knowledgeable electrician to help you navigate this side of things.""",Uncategorized,bing,"The article offers a practical guide on home charging options for electric vehicle (EV) owners, focusing on the steps and costs involved in setting up a home charging system.

(WIS) - Two brand-new vehicles are set to make electric vehicles more accessible in South Carolina. On Thursday, Scout Motors unveiled the Terra and the Traveler. The SUV and truck are fully electric vehicles with a projected 350-mile range. In one of the state’s largest economic developments, the vehicles will be produced at the upcoming production facility in Blythewood, SC. Scout Motors is projecting to roll out its first vehicles by the end of 2026. Scout Motors, which broke ground at its new production center back in February, received a $1.3 billion incentive package from Gov. Henry McMaster. The automotive company said the $2 billion facility will span 1,100 acres and deliver 4,000 jobs to the surrounding area. “It’s an exciting day for South Carolina and I know there will be more and more, but the excitement that is here today on this mountaintop is going to be hard to beat,” said Governor McMaster. McMaster continued, “We’re proud that these auto manufacturers and others want to be in South Carolina. This is one more, this is a great one, and we are delighted to be here. You can just feel the excitement in this place.” McMaster joined Scout enthusiasts, executives, and employees for Thursday’s reveal in Franklin, Tennessee. Scout Motors unveils vehicles set for production at upcoming Blythewood facility - 7 p.m. President and CEO of Scout Motors, Scott Keogh, said the plant will be able to produce 40 cars an hour once it’s operational. The Terra features a 5.5-foot bed, a large center display, front storage, and accelerates from 0-60pmh in 3.5 seconds. From interior to exterior, the vehicle pays homage to the very first Scout vehicle in the 1960s. The Traveler, Scouts' newest SUV model will feature a similar body type to historic Scout SUVs. It will have similar interior features to that of the Terra but with a glass roof and a split tailgate. Chief design officer Chris Benjamin says Scout is confident the new lineup will meet the needs of hardworking South Carolinians. “People take pride in what they’re involved in,” Benjamin said. “So if you have people in South Carolina working in the plant and building these vehicles, they’re drawn to it. It is going to be a special one.” “Economic development, if you have an automotive company, is just great,” said Joern Petri, vice president of Plant Launch. “You have suppliers that are coming in, the qualified labor, 4,000 jobs, 4,000 families...” “Everyone needs a haircut, everyone needs to buy groceries, so it’s not just the factory or company that is benefiting; it’s the community that’s benefiting from an automotive factory.” The construction of the Blythewood plant is on schedule, with nearly 78 percent of the assembly building foundation completed and 57 percent of the steel installed. Petri says Scout is already in conversation with K12 schools across Richland County, SC Ready, and Midlands Tech; with hopes to train, qualify, and then employ. He also says this is a chance for South Carolina to see what the future holds, not only for electric vehicles but as the state transitions into a leading role for vehicle manufacturing. Both vehicles will be priced between $50,000-60,000. As of Thursday, they are accepting reservations for both vehicles. Copyright 2024 WHNS.

European tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles: All you need to know,"New EU tariffs apply on electric vehicles imported from China as of Wednesday. They remain in place for the next five years.

The new levy concerns European car makers too. ADVERTISEMENT New EU tariffs apply on electric vehicles imported from China as of Wednesday. They remain in place for the next five years. However, negotiations are expected to continue between the EU and China, and the EU could lift the duties if an agreement is reached. Related EU gives final green light to steep tariffs on Chinese electric cars EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. Here are some basic facts about the EU's customs duties: What did the European Union do? The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that enables them to undercut rivals in the EU on price, take a large market share and threaten European jobs. The duties differ depending on the maker: 17% for BYD, 18.8% for Geely and 35.3% for state-owned SAIC. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to a 20.7% duty. The Commission has an individually calculated rate for Tesla of 7.8%. ""By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,"" European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said. Why did the commission take action? Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the Commission has said. The Commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production. Subsidised solar panels from China have wiped out European producers - an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their car industry. Unusually, the Commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European car industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have opposed the tariffs. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas. How is China reacting? Beijing has been sharply critical of the investigation and the higher duties, describing them as protectionist and unfair. The Commerce Ministry has also launched anti-dumping investigations into European exports of brandy, pork and dairy products. Earlier this month, it announced provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on French and other European brandies, after EU member countries voted in favour of finalising the tariffs on EVs. Officials have also said that they are deliberating whether to raise tariffs on imports of petrol-powered vehicles with large engines. ADVERTISEMENT Talks between the two sides have focused in recent weeks on so-called ""price commitments"" as a possible resolution. In such a scenario, car makers would agree to a minimum selling price for their EVs in Europe. Some Chinese automakers are looking at making cars in Europe to avoid any tariffs and be closer to the market. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region. How do the EU tariffs compare to the ones announced by the US? The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the US tariffs will block virtually all Chinese EV imports. That is not what Europe wants to do. ADVERTISEMENT EU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 - but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition The planned tariffs are aimed at levelling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese car makers. European countries subsidise electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all car makers or distort the market in favour of one side. What does this mean for European drivers and carmakers? It's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese car makers are able to make cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising prices. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, Chinese car makers often sell their vehicles overseas at much higher prices than in China, meaning they are favouring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even with a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations cited by AP. BYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of €21,769 ($23,370) in China but €41,990 ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for around $10,000 in China. While consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices later on, the Commission argues.",Business,bing,"The article provides detailed insights into the EU's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, highlighting key aspects of the trade dispute between the EU and China regarding electric vehicles.

EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. The duties took effect provisionally in July and were finalized after talks between the EU and China failed to resolve their differences. Negotiations are expected to continue, and the EU could lift the duties if an agreement is reached. Here are some basic facts about the EU's customs duties: What did the European Union do? The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that enables them to undercut rivals in the EU on price, take a large market share and threaten European jobs. The duties differ depending on the maker: 17% for BYD, 18.8% for Geely and 35.3% for state-owned SAIC. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to a 20.7% duty. The commission has an individually calculated rate for Tesla of 7.8%. “By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said. The duties will stay in force for five years unless an amicable solution is found. Why did the commission take action? Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission has said. The commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production. Subsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers — an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry. Unusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have opposed the tariffs. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas. How is China reacting? Beijing has been sharply critical of the investigation and the higher duties as protectionist and unfair. The Commerce Ministry has also launched anti-dumping investigations into European exports of brandy and pork and an investigation of dairy product subsidies. Earlier this month, it announced provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on French and other European brandies, after EU member countries voted in favor of finalizing the tariffs on EVs. Officials have also said that they are weighing whether to raise tariffs on imports of gasoline-powered vehicles with large engines. Talks between the two sides focused in recent weeks on so-called “price commitments” as a possible resolution. In such a scenario, carmakers would agree to a minimum selling price for their EVs in Europe. Some Chinese automakers are looking at making cars in Europe to avoid any tariffs and be closer to the market. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain’s Catalonia region. How do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.? The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports. That's not what Europe is trying to do. EU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 — but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition The planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers. European countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side. What does this mean for European drivers and carmakers? It's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising prices. Currently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles overseas at much higher prices than in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD’s six models would still earn a profit in Europe even with a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations. BYD’s Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium. The base model of BYD’s compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for around $10,000 in China. While consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

Here’s how it plans to do it. For years, Tesla has been guiding a roughly 50% growth rate in EV deliveries leading to 20 million cars per year in 2030. That growth crashed this year, and Tesla is now expected to be roughly flat in terms of car deliveries in 2024 compared to last year. Interestingly, the pause in growth has encouraged Tesla to share some more precise growth guidance for the first time in a while. Tesla has shared that it plans to grow deliveries between 20 and 30% in 2025. If Tesla can deliver a record number of 515,000 vehicles in Q4, as guided, it will deliver about 1,850,000 in 2024. It means that Tesla expects to deliver between 2.2 and 2.4 million electric vehicles in 2025. How does Tesla deliver this extra ~500,000 EVs Tesla has grown at a 30% rate in the past, but it has never done it when it was producing vehicles at such a high rate. It’s going to be a difficult task, but Tesla has a plan to make it happen. After a full year of production in 2024, Cybertruck is expected to contribute more in 2025. Tesla currently lists a production capacity about 125,000 units. That’s likely more than twice as many Cybertrucks as Tesla is expected to deliver this year. It remains to be seen if Tesla can find the demand for it, but the Cybertruck’s production ramp should contribute to Tesla’s growth in 2025 – although it will be far from enough to reach the goal. The real contributors are expected to be two new vehicles that Tesla is planning to launch in the first half of 2025. Earlier this year, we reported that Elon Musk had canceled plans for new, cheaper Tesla vehicles built on the new ‘unboxed’ platform, often referred to as “the $25,000 Tesla.” He has instead pushed for two new vehicle programs that incorporate some of the features of the new platform, but they are still primarily based on the Model 3/Y platform – so much so that they will be built on the same production lines. These currently unnamed new vehicles are expected to be cheaper than Model 3/Y, which currently start at $43,000 before incentives – likely closer to $30.000-$35,000. Those vehicles are expected to contribute more to Tesla’s growth, but since they will only launch in the first half of 2025, the contribution will be somewhat limited in 2025 as Tesla ramps up production. When discussing the growth guidance, Musk mentioned the “lower-cost vehicles” as contributing to the growth, but he also said that “the advent of autonomy” would contribute: We can’t overcome massive force majeure events, but I think with our lower-cost vehicles with the advent of autonomy, something like a 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess. It sounds like he means that the improvements in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving will help Tesla sell more vehicles. We previously reported on Musk explaining Tesla’s plan to roll out its unsupervised self-driving next year. Finally, Tesla is also planning to do a Model Y refresh early in 2025. That’s important because it is Tesla’s best-selling car by a wide margin. It should be a good thing for demand in 2025, but the switch over to the new design is going to affect production, which makes it a bit of a tossup to contribute to growth in 2025. Electrek’s Take I have already extensively shared my doubts about Tesla’s capacity to release unsupervised self-driving this year, so I don’t think it’s worth going too much into. FSD will likely improve next year and it could convince some people to buy Tesla vehicles, but I doubt it will be a significant factor. The new cheaper models are where the real opportunity is at, but like I said, it will depend on the production ramp. I think it’s also important to think about cannibalization. Many people think that because the new vehicles will be produced on the same production lines as Model 3 and Model Y they will look very similar, but that’s not necessarily the case. Tesla produces Model S and X on the same line, and they are fairly different. But even if they are fairly different, they will likely steal some sales from Tesla’s lower-end vehicles. I think Tesla can achieve that growth next year, but it won’t be easy.",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article provides a detailed insight into Tesla's projected growth in terms of electric vehicle deliveries.

ADVERTISEMENT The European Commission has given the final green light to steep tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, officially closing the probe that began one year ago. The tariffs will apply as of Wednesday and remain in place for the next five years. In the meantime, Brussels will continue negotiations with Beijing in an attempt to secure a deal on minimum prices that can replace the tariffs. However, this solution, advocated by Germany, is highly complex and would be difficult to implement on the ground. ""By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,"" said Valdis Dombrovskis, the Commission's executive vice president in charge of trade. The entry into force was widely expected after the inconclusive vote earlier this month where member states failed to mount the necessary majority in favour or against the measures. The Commission invoked its trade powers to break the impasse and approve the duties, which come on top of the existing 10% rate and vary according to brand, as below. Tesla: 7.8% BYD: 17% Geely: 18.8% SAIC: 35.3% Other EV producers in China who cooperated in the investigation but have not been individually sampled: 20.7% Other EV producers in China who did not cooperate: 35.3% The executive argues that additional tariffs are necessary to offset the effects of the subsidies it claims Beijing is injecting on a large scale across its domestic EV sector. The generous financial aid has allowed Chinese producers to sell their cars at artificially lower prices compared to their European competitors, the Commission attests. As a result, Chinese firms' EV sales in Europe have increased at extraordinary pace: their market share jumped from 1.9% in 2020 to 14.1% in the second quarter of 2024, according to the Commission's estimations. Brussels has repeatedly warned that, without taking forceful action, EU carmakers would suffer unsustainable losses and be pushed out of the lucrative market of net-zero mobility, leading to the closure of plants and the dismissal of thousands of workers. The bloc's automotive industry is already in turmoil due to high energy prices, sluggish consumer demand and intense global competition. ""There's a clear and imminent threat to our car industry not making the transition to electric vehicles and being therefore wiped out,"" a senior EU official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Despite the introduction of tariffs, Brussels claims it remains committed to finding a solution with Beijing enforceable by customs duties and compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, something that has so far proven elusive. China denounced the Commission's probe from the outset as a ""naked protectionist act"" consistently denying the existence of subsidies, describing the findings ""artificially constructed and exaggerated,"" and threatening retaliatory measures against the EU's dairy, brandy and pork industries, setting alarm bells ringing in some capitals. ""We disagreed on each and every fact that we established in the investigation,"" the senior EU official said. ""It was a broad disagreement.""

The EU on Tuesday decided to slap hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars after an anti-subsidy probe concluded Beijing's support undercut European automakers. The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears of provoking China's ire and setting off a bitter trade war. Beijing previously denounced the European Union's ""unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable protectionist practices"" during the probe. ""By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,"" EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement. ""We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field,"" he said. China slammed Brussels's decision on Wednesday morning, saying it did not ""agree with or accept"" the tariffs and had filed a complaint under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism. ""China will... take all necessary measures to firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" Beijing's commerce ministry said. The duties will come on top of the current 10 percent on imports of electric vehicles from China. The decision will become law after publication in the EU's official journal, which is expected later on Tuesday or Wednesday, and enter into force no later than Thursday, an EU official said. Brussels' probe found that China's state subsidies were unfairly undercutting European automakers. Once they come into effect, the tariffs will be definitive and last for five years. The extra duties also apply, at various rates, to vehicles made in China by foreign groups such as Tesla -- which faces a tariff of 7.8 percent. Chinese car giant Geely -- one of the country's largest sellers of EVs -- faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent. Ailing companies The tariffs do not have the support of the majority of the EU's 27 member states but in a vote early this month, the opposition was not enough to block them - which would have required at least 15 states representing 65 percent of the bloc's population. The EU launched the probe in a bid to protect its automobile industry, a major industrial player that provides jobs to around 14 million people. France, which pushed for the investigation, welcomed the decision. ""The European Union is taking a crucial decision to protect and defend our trade interests, at a time when our car industry needs our support more than ever,"" French Finance Antoine Armand said in a statement. But Europe's bigger carmakers, including German auto titan Volkswagen, have criticised the EU's approach and have urged Brussels to resolve the issue through talks. The extra tariffs are ""a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe,"" the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said on Tuesday after the announcement. Volkswagen, which has been hit hard by rising competition in China, has previously said the tariffs would not improve the competitiveness of the European automotive industry. That warning came weeks before the ailing giant announced plans on Monday to close at least three factories in Germany and cull tens of thousands of jobs. On Tuesday, Audi, a subsidiary of crisis-hit Volkswagen, announced its intention to stop production of electric vehicles at an embattled factory in Brussels at the end of February next year. Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to gaps and differences. ""We remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and WTO-compatible,"" Dombrovskis said, referring to the World Trade Organization. Retaliatory moves The EU now faces China's retaliation. China already said on October 8 it would impose provisional tariffs on brandy imported from the EU. Beijing has also launched probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products imported into China.

"Scout Motors Debuts All-Electric 2027 Traveler SUV, Terra Pickup","This extended range electric vehicle (EREV) configuration adds a gasoline-powered range extender/generator to the mix, allowing drivers to continue adventuring far off the electric grid.",https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/scout-motors-debut-all-electric-2026-traveler-suv-and-terra-pickup/,,2024-10-29 19:38:00,CNET,,"Scout Motors -- a new electric manufacturer with an old and storied name -- announced two new retro-styled and off-road capable EVs this week at an event outside of Nashville, Tennessee. Meet the Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra pickup, slated to begin deliveries in 2027. The rugged EVs combine trail-ready features like solid axles and locking differentials with future-ready tech, including bidirectional power delivery and the NACS charging standard. And if the looks alone weren't retro enough, there's a version that runs partially on gas. The VW Group launched the Scout Motors brand in 2022 after acquiring the trademark as part of its purchase of American truck manufacturer International Motors (previously Navistar International and, before that, International Harvester). The new rugged EV brand takes its name from the International Scout, a 4x4 off-road vehicle built in Fort Wayne, Indiana, during the 1960s and ’70s -- before the term “SUV” even existed. The startup, as CEO Scott Keogh calls it, is now headquartered in Virginia, operating independently of Volkswagen of America. Its mission is to manufacture exclusively off-road-capable electric trucks and SUVs, with a focus on the US market. (Keogh's last gig was as CEO of VW USA, where he helped launch the ID 4.) The Scout Traveler has a short wheelbase and even shorter overhangs, an ideal combination for highly technical off-roading. Scout Motors Let's first take a look at the Scout Traveler, a retro-styled SUV with a boxy, squared-off aesthetic. The two-tone, white-roof design pays generous homage to the classic Scout 800 and Scout II, but the super-short front overhang, upright proportions and broad-shouldered stance also bring to mind Ford’s recently revived Bronco. The Traveler's fascia is defined by a dark rectangular ""mask"" that integrates the SUV's square, quad-beam LED headlamps and grille. A similar mask element can be found at the rear end, only here the rear-mounted spare tire carrier is integrated into the design for a cohesive look. Swing the spare out of the way and the rear cargo space opens with a split tailgate. Up front, the hood and grille lift to reveal even more storage in the large ""frunk,"" similar to that of Ford's F-150 Lightning. The Terra is about 10 inches longer from bumper-to-bumper than the Rivian R1T and around 2 inches shy of Ford's F-150 Lightning. Scout Motors Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the SUV is the Scout Terra, a dual-cab midsize electric pickup truck that looks and feels like a shot aimed squarely over the bow of the Rivian R1T. The design carries over many of the same cues as the Traveler, but it has a three-box truck silhouette, a tougher-looking hood and a distinct bumper treatment. The pickup is also longer than the SUV (229.2 inches vs. 207.9 inches) with a longer wheelbase (148.6 inches vs. 120.4 inches). Without a spare tire hanging off the back, the “ghost light” taillights and Scout script badge stand out more, punctuating the 5.5-foot bed of the pickup. (That's a foot longer than the R1T for those measuring.) Look closely and you may also spy the Scout 80-inspired flick in the sheet metal crease where the bed meets the cab. These are modern EVs, so there's no escaping the inevitable massive touchscreen dominating their dashboards. However, chief designer Chris Benjamin tells us that physical controls are a big part of the brand's identity and interior design DNA. Big, beefy buttons and knobs can be found on the dashboard and steering wheel, giving passengers tactile control over the tech and climate systems. I especially dig the volume knob tucked into the edge of the screen, resembling a wristwatch crown for easy access by front-seat passengers. Though both EVs feature large screens, the Scouts' dashboards are also home to a plethora of big and beefy physical buttons and knobs. Scout Motors The dashboard behind the screen has a halo of accent lighting that echoes the exterior ghost lights at night and integrates a subtle lip that passengers can stand an iPad on. Scout’s large center console provides plenty of storage, but both the Traveler and Terra models can be optioned without it, offering a front bench seat instead -- probably my favorite bit of throwback flair. Scout's new EVs are built on a unique body-on-frame platform that's completely different from the MEB platform used by other VW Group EVs. Specifically designed for maximum off-road capability, the trucks each boast a solid rear axle, a disconnecting front sway bar for maximum articulation over uneven terrain, up to 35-inch tires, front and rear mechanical lockers and a nearly 3-foot wading depth. Specs are sparse this early in the game, but we're told to expect close to 1,000 pound-feet of torque and a 3.5-second 0-60 mph sprint. The Traveler will be able to trailer over 7,000 pounds while the Terra is said to haul over 10,000 pounds, with both trucks boasting nearly 2,000 pounds of payload. Like many of their electric competitors, the Traveler and Terra both feature large front trunks (or frunks) beneath their hoods. Scout Motors Scout estimates up to 350 miles of range per charge, but that's subject to change closer to launch. The automaker also hasn't specified exact battery capacity at this point. The EVs will be built on an 800-volt electric architecture, which should allow for relatively fast charging at a capable DC charger. Scout is adopting the North American Charging System at inception, so both EVs will have the Tesla-pioneered NACS port. Bidirectional charging will also be supported at launch along with vehicle-to-load power delivery via an assortment of 120-volt and 240-volt external outlets located next to the slim NACS plug or in the pickup's bed. The rugged utility vehicles will be built at Scout Motors' new $2 billion Blythewood, South Carolina, factory, which broke ground earlier this year. With an estimated capacity of around 200,000 vehicles annually, the factory is expected to begin pumping out the EVs in 2027. The Traveler and the Terra are projected to start ""below $60,000,"" and Scout reckons that price could get as low as $50,000 with incentives. (If there are still incentives to be had two years from now.) Behind the swinging spare tire, the Traveler's split tailgate opens wide to accept cargo. Scout Motors The automaker's ""one more thing"" at the end of the Traveler and Terra debut was a preview of Harvester variants of both models. This extended range electric vehicle (EREV) configuration adds a gasoline-powered range extender/generator to the mix, allowing drivers to continue adventuring far off the electric grid. That sounds a lot like a series plug-in hybrid to me, but Scout emphasizes that the combustion engine has no mechanical connection to the drive wheels -- the battery and e-motors are always turning the wheels -- so it's still technically an electric vehicle. It's unclear where that ICE will fit in the chassis, though judging by the location of the fuel door in photos, I'd guess it goes in the frunk. The conversion also requires the battery pack to shrink a bit to make room for the gas tank. Even so, Scout estimates a 500-mile range with a full tank and battery. I expect we'll learn more in the coming months. The original International Scout's competition included vehicles like Jeep's CJ Wrangler 4x4 and the Ford Bronco. Today, the Wrangler 4xe has been the best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle in America for three years running, and the Bronco returned to the market in 2021 with a wide range of rugged configurations and imposing names like Raptor and Sasquatch. The combustion-powered competition is joined by electric competition from General Motors, Tesla and, of course, Rivian. Scout's initial lineup of vehicles and the company's mission somewhat mirror that of another young American electric startup: Rivian. Scout Motors Rivian is an interesting analog to Scout's rebirth in the US. Both are new American brands that exclusively offer electric trucks and EV SUVs. Earlier this year, the Volkswagen Group and Rivian Motors inked a $5 billion investment and technology sharing partnership, so the connection between the brands may end up being more than that of fierce rivals. The specifics of how that partnership will work and how -- if at all -- Scout Motors will benefit have yet to be fleshed out. However, Scout’s mention of a new “modern zonal architecture,” over-the-air updates and remote diagnostic capabilities -- technologies pioneered in Rivan's recently updated R1 platform -- suggests the partnership may already be bearing fruit.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a detailed and well-rounded overview of Scout Motors' upcoming electric vehicles, the Traveler SUV, and Terra pickup truck.

(ticker: TSLA). Recently, after a demonstration of Tesla's upcoming capabilities, CEO Elon Musk made bold promises about the future of autonomous vehicles. Notably, he unveiled plans for the ""Cybercab,"" a fully autonomous taxi priced under $30,000 and set for production by 2026, alongside a 20-passenger robovan designed to transform urban mobility. Following these announcements and strong third-quarter earnings that beat expectations on earnings per share and gross margins, Tesla's stock surged 22%, reaching new highs for the year. Musk also teased plans for a lower-cost EV set to enter production in 2025. However, it's not just Tesla that is making waves. ""The EV industry in China continues to experience significant growth, with new EV sales surpassing 50% of total car sales for three consecutive months,"" says Anthony Sassine, senior investment strategist and head of Middle East and North Africa at KraneShares, an asset management firm. Sassine highlights that notable Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD Company Ltd. (OTC: BYDDF), Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd. (ZK) and Li Auto Inc. (LI) are leading the charge, with Nio Inc. (NIO) and XPeng Inc. (XPEV) also showing robust sales figures. ""Tesla has recently regained ground in China, but we believe its growth may still be hindered by a lack of new, lower-priced models,"" Sassine argues. For example, the current base model 2025 Tesla Model 3 starts at $44,130, while the BYD Han EV is priced at 229,800 Chinese yuan, or around $36,500. This competitive pressure underscores the importance of considering broader exposure to the EV market, including key players in China that could show up on American streets in the future. ""Looking ahead, we expect the EV industry to enter a second wave of growth, one that could surpass the first as mass adoption accelerates and EV infrastructure continues to expand globally,"" Sassine says. For investors looking to capitalize on the diverse opportunities within the global EV sector, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can offer a strategic tool. ""The EV ecosystem tends to be broad and includes many industries, so owning the entire basket rather than owning one or two companies alone tends to better diversify risks and provides a more balanced approach,"" Sassine says. Whether you're bullish on Tesla or looking to hedge with investments in its competitors, EV ETFs can offer a convenient and effective way to invest in the future of transportation. Here are seven of the best EV ETFs to buy today: ETF Expense ratio Average annual total return since inception KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF (KARS) 0.72% 5.6% iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (IDRV) 0.47% 6.0% Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) 0.68% 8.6% SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL) 0.45% 1.2% Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) 0.75% 3.9% Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) 0.59% -43.9% Invesco Electric Vehicle Metals Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (EVMT) 0.59% -19.8% KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF (KARS) ""While increased competition has pressured margins for some EV manufacturers and suppliers, it has also pushed the industry to find ways to lower EV prices,"" Sassine says. ""In response, luxury EV brands like Li Auto and Nio have introduced more affordable EV models, while others have reduced prices on existing models, bringing the industry closer to ICE parity."" For EVs, KraneShares offers KARS. This ETF tracks the Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Index, which encompasses the complete EV supply chain, including raw material production, manufacturing, sales and charging infrastructure. Thanks to KraneShares' Chinese market expertise, this ETF holds many hard-to-access ""A-Shares"" companies listed on mainland Chinese stock exchanges. The ETF charges a 0.72% expense ratio. iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (IDRV) ""We believe that EV adoption will still outpace traditional automotive sales growth over the long term due to increased efficiency in driving range, energy consumption and charging times, ultimately leading to lower operating cost and higher adoption,"" says Robert F. Draper Jr., founder and chief investment officer at Draper Asset Management. Another ETF investors can use for EV exposure is IDRV. This ETF tracks the NYSEA FactSet Global Autonomous Driving and Electric Vehicle Index, a globally diversified benchmark holding 49 companies. Top holdings currently include Tesla, Li Auto, XPeng, BYD and Nio. It is heavily weighted to the consumer discretionary sector and both the U.S. and Chinese EV industries at 30% and 26%, respectively. IDRV charges a 0.47% expense ratio. Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) ""It is our opinion that the major U.S. automotive manufacturers, commonly referred to as the 'Big Three,' have largely relinquished the pure EV market to Tesla and Chinese counterparts, most notably BYD,"" Draper notes. This trio includes General Motors Co. (GM), Ford Motor Co. (F) and Stellantis NV (STLA). While these manufacturers have long dominated the ICE industry, their EV efforts have largely faltered. Still, investors may still want to include these giants in the event that either EV market penetration slows, or their management executes a successful pivot later. For this role, consider DRIV, which owns the usual EV companies but also includes ICE manufacturers like General Motors, Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (HMC). DRIV charges a 0.68% expense ratio. SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL) HAIL is less of a pure EV play than a bet on the future of transportation. This ETF tracks the S&P Kensho Smart Transportation Index, which holds EV industry stocks but also owns companies that manufacture drones, autonomous vehicles, transportation tracking and Internet of Things technology for vehicles. It charges a 0.45% expense ratio and has around $27 million in assets under management. HAIL's benchmark is a composite, blending the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index, the S&P Kensho Autonomous Vehicles Index, the S&P Kensho Advanced Transport Systems Index and the S&P Kensho Drones Index. The end result is a portfolio of 71 companies, with 23% belonging to automotive manufacturing and another 16% comprising automotive parts and manufacturing. Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) The EV supply chain doesn't start with manufacturers. Arguably, it begins when the critical materials for batteries are mined, notably lithium. Lithium is a crucial component in the production of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which power the majority of commercially available EVs today. For exposure to the lithium ecosystem, Global X ETFs offers LIT at a 0.75% expense ratio. LIT tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index, which retains some exposure to notable EV manufacturers like Tesla and BYD. However, the ETF is largely dominated by materials sector companies due to its focus on miners. Notably, the top holding in LIT is Albemarle Corp. (ALB), a leading producer of lithium and a large supplier for global EV manufacturers. LIT currently has just over $1.3 billion in assets. Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) ""BATT offers investors an affordable entry into the fast-growing lithium and battery technology market, providing global exposure to the full battery ecosystem from raw materials to EV and energy storage manufacturers as well as charging infrastructure companies,"" says Christian Magoon, founder and CEO of Amplify ETFs. The ETF charges a 0.59% expense ratio, lower than competitor LIT. This ETF tracks the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology Index. In terms of top holdings, BATT owns both BYD and Tesla, and also BHP Group Ltd. (BHP), a notable large-cap Australian-based lithium miner. ""Since BATT's launch in 2018, we've seen additional demand drivers emerge for these metals from mobile technology and the need for large-scale energy storage,"" Magoon explains. Invesco Electric Vehicle Metals Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (EVMT) According to asset management firm Invesco, rather than betting on EV companies, which may or may not survive given increased competition, holding direct exposure to the actual metals used in EV manufacturing may be a more efficient approach. For this role, Invesco offers EVMT, a unique ETF that tracks the S&P GSCI Electric Vehicle Metals Index for a 0.59% expense ratio.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article titled ""7 Best Electric Vehicle ETFs to Buy"" primarily focuses on providing investment insights into the electric vehicle (EV) industry rather than offering original insights or analysis on electric vehicles themselves.

The EU Is Imposing Duties on Electric Vehicles From China After Trade Talks Fail,The EU Is Imposing Duties on Electric Vehicles From China After Trade Talks Fail BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is imposing duties on imports of electric vehicles from China starting ...,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-10-29/the-eu-will-impose-duties-on-electric-vehicle-imports-from-china-from-thursday,,2024-10-29 12:11:00,U.S. News & World Report,,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is imposing duties on imports of electric vehicles from China starting Wednesday after talks between Brussels and Beijing failed to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. “By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. “In parallel, we remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and (World Trade Organization)-compatible,” he added. The duties would stay in force for five years, unless an amicable solution is found. According to the commission, which manages trade disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, sales of Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties on Chinese manufacturers will be 17% on cars made by BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an “individually calculated” rate for Tesla of 7.8%. China’s Commerce Ministry objected to the measures as protectionist and unfair. “China does not agree with it and will not accept the ruling” the ministry's statement said. “China will continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.” The EU’s retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers. The head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the imposition of the tariffs is “a setback for free global trade and so for prosperity, the preservation of jobs and Europe’s growth.” Hildegard Müller said the move increases the risk of a far-reaching trade conflict. “The industry is not naive in dealing with China, but the challenges must be resolved in dialogue,” Müller said in a statement. The measures were published in the bloc's legal Official Journal late Tuesday, meaning duties enter into force as of midnight, said EU spokeswoman Arianna Podesta. The commission says China boosted its EU market share with the help of subsidies across the production chain. These ranged from cheap land for factories provided by local governments, to cut-price supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises, to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in China's market share has sparked concern in the EU that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU’s ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change. Business groups and unions also fear that the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers could be put in jeopardy, as well those of 10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly on EV production. ___ Associated Press journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.

But the contest looks much different today. Sales of G.M.’s battery-powered models are starting to surge as the company begins to reap its big investments in standardized batteries and new factories. Ford’s three electric models, including the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and a Transit van, are still selling well but are racking up billions of dollars of losses. The latest view into how Ford’s quick-start strategy has run into trouble came on Monday, when the company reported that its electric vehicle division lost $1.2 billion before interest and taxes from July to September. In the first nine months of the year, it lost $3.7 billion. Ford’s chief financial officer, John Lawler, said it was a “solid quarter,” noting that revenue had risen for the 10th quarter in a row, by 5 percent to $46.2 billion.

"Tesla Makes Money Selling Electric Vehicles, but 86% of Its Earnings Could Soon Come From This Instead",Electric vehicle sales account for 79% of Tesla's revenue at the moment. Ark Investment Management predicts that's going to change thanks to Tesla's self-driving software and robotaxi. Tesla's ...,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/27/tesla-makes-money-selling-electric-vehicles-but-86/,,2024-10-27 05:47:00,The Motley Fool,,"Cathie Wood doesn't believe Tesla's future rests on selling passenger electric vehicles. Cathie Wood is the head of Ark Investment Management, which operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technology companies. Tesla (TSLA 3.80%) stock is one of the top positions across Ark's portfolios, and Wood calls it the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity in the world thanks to the company's full self-driving (FSD) software. Tesla currently generates around 79% of its revenue by selling passenger electric vehicles (EVs), but Ark released a set of financial models earlier this year that suggest that number is about to shrink significantly. In fact, by 2029, Ark predicts a whopping 86% of Tesla's earnings will come from something else entirely. Tesla's passenger EV business is struggling at the moment When Tesla stock came public in 2010, few analysts believed the company would succeed in mass-producing EVs. It certainly proved them wrong, and it delivered a record 1.8 million units in 2023 alone. However, sales are clearly slowing. Tesla delivered 1.29 million EVs in the first three quarters of 2024, which represented a drop of 2.3% compared to the same period last year. That means its annual deliveries are on track to shrink for the first time since it launched the flagship Model S in 2011 -- even though the company has drastically slashed prices over the past year to boost demand. Demand is softening across the EV industry right now as consumers opt for cheaper gas-powered cars amid tough economic conditions headlined by high interest rates. Plus, a report by Goldman Sachs suggests consumers are concerned about a lack of rapid charging infrastructure, as well as the declining resale value of EVs in general. But Tesla also faces a growing competitive threat, with low-cost manufacturers like China-based BYD threatening to flood global markets with cheap EVs. BYD's Seagull sells for under $10,000 in China, and it could be on its way to Europe in 2025. Those are important geographic markets for Tesla, and none of its passenger EVs can compete at that price point. Tesla CEO Elon Musk outlined plans to build a low-cost EV, which was expected to go into production in 2025 and sell for $25,000, but during his conference call with investors for the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), he said the project is no longer going ahead. FSD and robotaxis are the way forward, according to Musk Musk says building a low-cost passenger EV is ""pointless"" because Tesla's future is in autonomous vehicles instead. The company unveiled the Cybercab earlier this month, which is a self-driving robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. The Cybercab will run on Tesla's FSD software, which the company has been developing for years. However, it does not have approval for unsupervised use in the U.S. yet, and a human driver must be ready to take over at all times. But based on the data collected from extensive beta testing in its passenger EVs, it is possible that the Cybercab is already safer than the average car on the road. According to Tesla's most recent quarterly vehicle safety report, FSD caused one crash every 7 million miles, compared to one crash every 700,000 miles for the average U.S. driver. In other words, FSD is 10 times safer than human-driven vehicles, statistically speaking, as it stands today. The software will only get better over time because the AI models upon which it is based are constantly learning from new data. Tesla is currently building a cluster of 50,000 graphics processing chips (GPUs) from Nvidia to train FSD further. In fact, the company is on track to spend $11 billion on AI data center infrastructure this year for that very purpose. As a result, Musk expects the software to eventually receive regulatory approval for unsupervised use. He says it could be available in Texas next year, and potentially California. FSD could transform Tesla's economics Tesla expects to monetize FSD in three primary ways: Selling the software to owners of Tesla's passenger EVs. Licensing the software to other car manufacturers for a fee. Through a ride-hailing network Tesla built in-house, which will allow Cybercabs to transport passengers at all hours of the day (like Uber, except completely driverless). Owners of Tesla's passenger EVs will also be able to lend their FSD-enabled cars to the network to earn extra income, which will be split with the company. Plus, the Cybercab will be available for purchase for an expected price of $30,000, so practically anybody can buy a fleet and set up their own driverless ride-hailing network. All of those revenue sources could carry high profit margins. Software companies, for example, often have a gross profit margin of 80% or more, which is far higher than Tesla's current gross margin of 19.8% across its portfolio of hardware businesses today. Plus, Uber paid its drivers a whopping $17.9 billion in the last quarter alone, which was its largest expense by far. That's an indication of how much money Tesla could save with an autonomous ride-hailing network operating at scale. Ark's financial models suggest Tesla will generate $1.2 trillion in annual revenue by 2029, with FSD and Cybercab accounting for 63%. However, thanks to those high profit margins, Ark believes those products will account for 86% of a forecast $440 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Ark's forecast might be ambitious, and Tesla stock isn't cheap right now Wall Street's consensus estimate (according to Yahoo) suggests Tesla is on track to generate $99 billion in total revenue in 2024. That means it will have to grow twelvefold by 2029 -- or by a compound annual rate of 64.7% for the next five years -- to meet Ark's forecast. FSD and the Cybercab will have to scale up rapidly for Tesla to grow at that pace, because $99 billion in revenue this year would represent growth of just 2% compared to 2023. In 2025, Wall Street expects revenue to grow by just 15%. Simply put, passenger EV sales alone won't get the job done. Plus, investors have to pay a hefty price to bet on Tesla's autonomous future, because its stock currently trades at a steep premium to the broader market. Based on its trailing-12-month earnings per share of $3.65, its stock currently sits at a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 68.5. That's more than double the 32.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 technology index. Tesla's future is incredibly exciting, but according to Musk's own forecast, the Cybercab won't go into mass production until 2026. That means the company's fate will rest on passenger EV sales for at least the next year. While Musk thinks they could grow by as much as 30% in 2025, I have doubts, considering the low-cost model is no longer going ahead, which leaves the brand susceptible to competitors like BYD. In summary, Ark might be right about FSD and the Cybercab eventually, but its 2029 target is ambitious. Therefore, it might be best to wait until we receive more information next year before buying Tesla stock. Alternatively, if there is a pullback that brings its P/E ratio in line with the Nasdaq-100, that might be a good opportunity to take a long-term position.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides unique insights into Tesla's strategic shift from a focus on electric vehicle (EV) sales to the development of self-driving technology and autonomous vehicles, which is a fresh perspective in the context of Tesla's business model.

The automaker is looking into incorporating more ICE and hybrid options into lineups that were developed as EV-only. New 718 models and the Macan SUV were conceived as EVs, and it may be too late to easily adapt them to combustion power. Porsche is making some radical changes to its electrification strategy in response to slumping Taycan sales and a stubborn loyalty among customers to good old combustion-powered machines. For a brand that up until now seemed all-in on electric, the pivot speaks volumes about Porsche’s read on its buyers’ preferences—and their reluctance to abandon traditional powertrains. The automaker, which has publicly come out against Europe’s proposed 2035 ban on combustion engines, is now investigating how it might re-engineer future cars that were designed as EVs to accept hybrid powerplants. But that’s going to take a herculean effort and ton of cash if it’s even possible. More: Porsche Confirms New 911 Turbo Hybrid Coming Next Year The next-generation 718 Boxster and Cayman sports cars are fully electric, fully signed off and will be launched in the coming months. It’s possible Porsche could reverse-engineer them to accept combustion engines, as Fiat has been forced to do with the 500e. However, even if they greenlighted the idea, it would be years before a retrofitted model hit the road, assuming it’s financially worthwhile at all. Another vehicle that Porsche conceived as an EV, but which must be under consideration for a combustion rethink is the flagship K1 SUV due in 2028. The timeframe and likely dimensions of the three-row K1 suggest it has a better chance of being adapted to hybrid power. Next Cayenne will be available with combustion or electric power Customer Demand Drives Strategy Shift “A lot of customers in the premium and luxury segment are looking in the direction of combustion-engined cars, there’s a clear trend,” Porsche CFO Lutz Meschke said in a conference call before going on to explain how the brand is reacting to that news. “We will refresh our combustion engine cars, including the Panamera and the Cayenne, and of course, we will continue to rely on plug-in hybrids” Meschke added. Flexible Production for a Mixed Lineup “As for our electrified lineup, we are very flexible when it comes to our production footprint. We can produce combustion engine, plug-in hybrids and electrified cars in one production line in Leipzig,” Meschke continued. “When it comes to research and development, you’ll see more flexibility in the upcoming years. We will develop new combustion-engined derivatives [of our EVs] in order to give the right answer to customer demand.” Related: Porsche Taycan Sales Are A Disaster, But Cayenne Saves The Day Porsche had at one time planned for 80 percent of its lineup to be EVs by the end of the decade. The remaining 20 percent would be accounted for by the 911, which has gained its first hybrid model, but was always going to stay away from fully-electric power until well into the 2030s. Porsche enjoyed early success with the Taycan and engineered an electric Macan and the upcoming 718 EVs, with visions of those models taking over from the older ICE equivalent after being offered in tandem during a handover period. Sales Drop Challenges Porsche’s EV Push But Taycan sales have tanked this year despite the introduction of a facelifted model, particularly in the once-lucrative Chinese market, while combustion 718 sales have rallied as buyers get them while they can.

It will marks Lancia’s first exclusively electric model under the Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategy, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2038. By 2028, Lancia’s lineup will be fully electric, starting with the Gamma, and eventually the Delta. Update 10/25: It’s been a full year since we last heard anything official about the upcoming Lancia Gamma, but today Stellantis finally tossed us a teaser. Don’t get too excited, though—the “news” just rehashes what CEO Luca Napolitano already confirmed in 2023. Yes, the mid-sized Gamma will be built on the STLA Medium platform, and yes, production is set to start at Stellantis’ Melfi plant in Italy in 2026. In other words, nothing new here, but we guess Stellantis has to keep the Lancia revival hype on life support somehow. “The new Lancia Gamma represents a milestone in our journey towards the future”, says Luca Napolitano, Lancia CEO, in what’s starting to feel like standard-issue corporate optimism to hide the gloom and doom. “It embodies our brand’s commitment to sustainability and high performance, while celebrating the unmistakable elegance that has defined Lancia for decades. By producing it at the historic Melfi plant, we are strengthening our connection to Italy’s rich automotive heritage and advancing our vision for an electrified future. Gamma will showcase the best of what Lancia stands for: innovation, style, and a relentless pursuit of excellence” Lancia has unveiled its roadmap for the upcoming decade, and it’s no surprise that electrification takes center stage. The journey began with the introduction of the new Ypsilon in 2024, which will be followed by the launch of the flagship Gamma EV in 2026, and culminating with an all-electric Delta in 2028. The Italian brand confirmed that the upcoming Ypsilon will be offered in both pure battery-powered and hybrid variants. However, beginning in 2026, the company will exclusively introduce new EVs, and by 2028, their entire lineup will consist solely of electric-powered models. This implies that the hybrid Ypsilon will have a relatively short lifespan, lasting only four years. In 2026, Lancia is set to debut its first exclusive electric vehicle, to be manufactured at Stellantis’ Melfi plant in Italy. Measuring in at 185 inches (4.7 meters) long, it will be roughly the same size as a BMW 4-series. Lancia’s CEO, Luca Napolitano, says that it will be an elegant fastback that is based on the STLA medium platform. Notably, he had previously confirmed the resurrection of the Gamma nameplate. “Our second flagship car, slated to debut in 2026, will be named ‘Gamma,'” Napolitano affirmed. More: What We Know About The 2028 Lancia Delta Premium Hatch The 2023 Lancia Ypsilon “The flagship of Casa Lancia will be a beautiful and elegant Italian car, beautiful outside and beautiful inside, where it will really look like you feel in the living room of an Italian house,” said Napolitano. “The STLA Medium platform will be perfect for Lancia, as a native BEV will be very efficient and will guarantee high levels of comfort, offering both a front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive version.” Thanks to its platform, Lancia anticipates that the flagship model will get up to 435 miles (700 km) of range per charge. It also expects 50 percent of the EV’s sales to come from European countries outside of Italy. Illustrations Francois Hubert/SB-Medien for CarScoops Unfortunately, few details have been revealed about the new Delta, which is due in 2028, but speaking to Italian media in the past, Luca Napolitano confirmed the return of the compact model saying: “It will return and it will be a true Delta – an exciting car, a manifesto of progress and technology, and obviously it will be electric”.

Scout Motors mounts an electric comeback with new SUV and truck concepts,"The brand went bust in 1980 — but now, it’s back, and it’s all-electric.

The brand went bust in 1980 — but now, it’s back, and it’s all-electric. Scout, which is now an independent company under the Volkswagen Group, introduced its first new-concept vehicles today: the Terra truck and the Traveler SUV. Both vehicles are body-on-frame, sitting on top a brand-new EV platform unique to Scout. And both could start at under $60,000 (without incentives) when production begins in 2027. But beyond the novelty of launching a new EV brand when sales are still struggling, and on the eve of a major election that could determine the future of the auto industry, Scout is trying to sell something that no one has really tried before: a genuine throwback that also feels modern and fresh. “It’s sort of this simple concept, but tough to execute,” said Scout CEO Scott Keogh, defining it as “heritage meets ingenuity.” The “Connection Machine” Before we get to the story of Scout’s comeback, let’s run through the specs, because there are some real doozies here: Body-on-frame chassis, solid rear axle, and front and rear mechanical lockers for off-road performance Projected towing of over 7,000 pounds for the Scout Traveler and over 10,000 pounds for the Scout Terra, both with nearly 2,000 pounds of payload Estimated zero to 60mph acceleration in 3.5 seconds, made possible by an estimated 1,000 pound-feet of torque through the four-wheel-drive system Vehicle software built upon a modern zonal architecture, enabling over-the-air updates and remote diagnostics Bidirectional charging and vehicle-to-home capabilities One fully electric trim with up to 350 miles of range and an extended range model with more than 500 miles of range through a gas-powered range extender There’s a lot more, including a removable cabana roof, optional bench seats in both the front and rear, and a lot of tactile touchpoints, like mechanical door handles, grab bars, and big, chunky dials and switches. Bench seats! Image: Scout Motors When I first spoke to Keogh earlier this year, he told me he didn’t want to make another hyperminimalist EV, festooned with touchscreens, glassy surfaces, and haptic buttons. He wanted to make something that was real and mechanical — something that you could grab and feel connected to. “There’s definitely a large segment that wants to bring forth some of the heritage thing,” he said this week. “They don’t want to be isolated from the car... They want to have real switches. They want to have mechanical touch and feel.” Keogh says the company is calling it the “Connection Machine” — a phrase it appears to be trying to trademark. The idea is that when you’re behind the wheel, tearing through some gravel or ripping up a 100 percent grade, you’re connected to the car through the physical act of driving but also your passengers, bumping up against each other on the same bench seat. Previous Next 1 / 9 Previous Next 1 / 9 In the zone That said, there are plenty of design and engineering choices that prove that Scout has its sights set firmly on the horizon. The inclusion of a zonal architecture, rather than a domain-style electrical setup, will help ensure that the vehicles have a lot of “headroom” for future updates, Keogh said, reducing costs not only on the manufacturing side but also for owners through reduced maintenance costs. Zonal architecture is still relatively niche in the auto industry. Tesla has been doing it for years, but most automakers use domain architectures, with dozens of electronic control units that control everything from power windows and airbags to braking. Rivian recently switched to a zonal system when it launched the next-gen versions of its R1 vehicles. And VW (which owns Scout) made a big deal of licensing Rivian’s “zonal hardware design” when it announced its plan to invest $5 billion in the EV company. Scout had the benefit of starting with a “clean sheet,” Keogh told me. “All these things sound quite minor but setting up your IT architecture without a legacy system — this is huge.” Platform politics Another thing that caught my attention was the news that the Terra and Traveler would be built on “an all-new and proprietary body-on-frame platform.” The fact that Scout would develop its own platform, rather than borrow VW’s modular “MEB” electric vehicle platform, might strike some as strange considering how expensive and labor-intensive it is for a brand-new company to develop its own bespoke platform. Sharing platforms is very common, especially when trying to spin up an entirely new production line. (For example, the Audi RS E-tron GT is built on the same platform as the Porsche Taycan.) “They want to have mechanical touch and feel” To be sure, VW has been going through its own struggles around EVs. The company’s plug-in models are selling well, but its market share in North America is shrinking. And its software has been plagued by bugs and customer complaints. But Keogh assured me that Scout wasn’t trying to ignore its advantages over some of its rivals. The company wants to maintain its individuality but will still share some components with its parent company, like drive units and other modules. Considering VW has never before competed in the off-road segment, Scout will take those components and piece them together into something that can tackle the roughest conditions. “The last thing we want to do is to grab a 100 percent carryover platform with all the modules,” Keogh said, “because then we’d be a badge. And Scout won’t work as a badge at all.” Range life The inclusion of a gas-powered range extender is also sure to raise some eyebrows. At a time when car buyers are flocking to hybrids, Scout certainly could have gone that route and no one would have complained. Instead, the company opted to include a small gas-powered generator that charges the battery, rather than powering the engine. The reason for this was twofold. First, electric trucks have historically struggled with range when carrying heavy payloads or towing large objects. Scout needs to convince truck shoppers that they can do all the truck stuff they love without sacrificing range. The other reason is that Keogh firmly believes that EVs are the future, and he wanted a vehicle that put battery power first, while still offering a smidge of fossil fuels to help quell range anxiety. “It introduces the buyer to electrification on their American terms,” he said. Not dystopian The look of the Terra and Traveler will be immediately recognizable to a lot of people. It successfully blends designs from Ram, Jeep, Range Rover, and Rivian (Scout’s chief designer hails from Stellantis and BMW), while also keeping the same iconic look and feel of the original International Harvester Scouts from the 1960s and ’70s. Keogh said the goal was to land somewhere between avant-garde and safe. In other words, not too dystopian, like the Tesla Cybertruck, but not overly familiar, like the Ford F-150 Lightning. “I think it’s got its own stance and its own world,” he said. “But of course, if you see little glimpses of Range Rover, little glimpses of Rivian, little glimpses of Ram, and a little bit of Scout, okay that sounds cool to me.”",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article offers a detailed and unique analysis of Scout Motors' reemergence into the electric vehicle market with its new SUV and truck concepts.
