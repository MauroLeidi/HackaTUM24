Jetzt ist das Unternehmen jedoch zahlungsunfähig. Welche Auswirkungen hat das auf das Bauprojekt? Update vom 22. November, 11:30 Uhr: Nach dem Antrag des finanziell angeschlagenen schwedischen Batterieherstellers Northvolt auf Gläubigerschutz in den USA ist Firmenchef Peter Carlsson zurückgetreten. Er bleibe dem Unternehmen aber als Mitglied des Aufsichtsrates sowie als führender Berater erhalten, teilte Northvolt in Stockholm mit. Carlsson führte Northvolt seit der Firmengründung im Jahr 2016 und zählt zu den Mitgründern des Unternehmens. Peter Carlsson hat seinen Rücktritt als Northvolt-Chef angekündigt. (Archivbild) © Marcus Brandt/dpa Erstmeldung vom 22. November, 8:30 Uhr: Stockholm/Heide – Die Krise in der Automobilindustrie hat Folgen für die ganze Lieferkette. Für Elektroautos bedeutet das unweigerlich die Batterien, bei denen Europa ohnehin schwächer dasteht als die Konkurrenz aus China. Das schwedische Unternehmen Northvolt sollte das ändern und zu Europas wichtigstem Batterieproduzenten wachsen. Dieses Vorhaben erhält nun einen Rückschlag: Die Firma ist insolvent. Northvolt meldet Insolvenz an: Batteriehersteller hat Milliarden-Schulden Der angeschlagene schwedische Batteriehersteller Northvolt hat Gläubigerschutz nach US-Recht beantragt und sucht nun nach einem weiteren Investor. Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag (21. November) mit. Das Sanierungsverfahren nach Kapitel 11 (Chapter 11) des US-Insolvenzrechts schützt Northvolt für eine gewisse Zeit vor dem Zugriff seiner Gläubiger und erleichtert damit den finanziellen Neustart. „Das über allem stehende Ziel ist es, mit einem oder mehreren langfristigen strategischen oder Finanzinvestoren zusammenzuarbeiten“, hieß es in den Gerichtsunterlagen. Zugleich erhält das Unternehmen Zugriff auf 245 Millionen Dollar und kann damit sein Überleben in den kommenden Wochen gewährleisten. Der Schritt, in den USA Gläubigerschutz zu suchen, kommt nicht überraschend: Die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters hatte vergangenen Freitag unter Berufung auf Insider gemeldet, dass Northvolt den Schritt in Betracht ziehe. Northvolt verfügt den Gerichtsunterlagen zufolge derzeit nur noch über flüssige Mittel von 30 Millionen Dollar – das reicht den Angaben nach gerade noch für eine Woche. Zugleich liegt der Schuldenberg inzwischen bei 5,8 Milliarden Dollar. Das Unternehmen hatte in den vergangenen Monaten mit seinen Geldgebern über ein Finanzierungspaket verhandelt, allerdings ohne Erfolg. Insolvenz von schwedischem Batteriehersteller: Volkswagen ist größter Anteilseigner Nun stellt der schwedische Lkw-Hersteller Scania Northvolt ein Darlehen in Höhe von 100 Millionen Dollar zur Verfügung. Damit solle die Herstellung von Batteriezellen für E-Fahrzeuge im nordschwedischen Skelleftea unterstützt werden. Scania bezieht schon jetzt Batterien von Northvolt. Die weiteren 145 Millionen Dollar sind Mittel von Northvolt, die bislang als Sicherheiten zurückgelegt wurden. Der größte Anteilseigner ist Volkswagen, auch die US-Investmentbank Goldman Sachs und BMW gehören zu den Eigentümern. BMW und Goldman Sachs lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab. Volkswagen erklärte am Abend, man stehe mit Northvolt in engem Kontakt. Die vom Northvolt-Mitbegründer Harald Mix geleitete Investmentgruppe Vargas beschrieb den Schritt als notwendig, um die Kapitalstruktur zu stärken. Gleichzeitig könne das Unternehmen den Betrieb aufrechterhalten, sich auf die Steigerung der Fertigungszahlen konzentrieren und die Kosten senken. Man sei überzeugt, dass Northvolt diese Zeit durchstehen werde. Northvolt selbst erklärte, das Unternehmen erwarte, die Restrukturierung bis zum ersten Quartal 2025 abzuschließen. Solange werde der Betrieb wie gehabt weitergehen. BMW zog Mega-Deal mit Northvolt zurück – Northvolt-Insolvenz ist Rückschlag für die Branche Der Batteriehersteller benötigt derzeit dringend Geld und arbeitet seit mehreren Wochen mit seinen Investoren an einem Rettungspaket. Die schwedische Regierung hatte jüngst erklärt, keine Anteile von Northvolt übernehmen zu wollen. Northvolt hat noch nie einen Gewinn erwirtschaftet und kämpft mit Qualitätsproblemen und Verzögerungen. Im Juni zog deswegen BMW einen Auftrag mit einem Volumen von zwei Milliarden Euro zurück. Wegen wegbrechender Aufträge und Problemen beim Hochfahren der Produktion hatte der Konzern zuletzt seine Ausbaupläne massiv eingedampft, tausende Mitarbeiter entlassen und Tochtergesellschaften verkauft. Noch am Mittwoch ernannte Northvolt den Sanierungsexperten Paul O‘Donnell zum Chef seiner Hauptanlage in Nordschweden. Der Antrag auf Gläubigerschutz ist ein Rückschlag für die europäischen Bemühungen, sich mit einer eigenen Batterie-Industrie unabhängiger von chinesischen Herstellern wie CATL und BYD zu machen. Nach Daten der Internationalen Energieagentur ist 85 Prozent der Batteriezellen-Herstellung in der Volksrepublik beheimatet. Northvolt hat zwar eine Reihe von europäischen Startups bei der Investition von Milliardensummen in die Batteriefertigung angeführt. Allerdings ist die Nachfrage nicht so schnell angestiegen wie von Teilen der Branche vorhergesagt. Northvolt baut Fabrik in Deutschland: Bau wird sich wohl verzögern Noch ist nicht abzusehen, was das konkret für den Bau einer Northvolt-Gigafabrik im schleswig-holsteinischen Heide bedeutet. Das Unternehmen erklärte dazu am Abend: Die deutsche Tochter werde unabhängig von der Muttergesellschaft finanziert. „Sie ist nicht Teil des Chapter 11-Verfahrens.“ Deutschlandchef Christofer Haux sagte, „in Dithmarschen schreiten die Bauarbeiten derweil weiter voran. Der Standort genießt höchste Priorität.“ Klar ist aber bereits, die Fabrik soll später ihre Arbeit aufnehmen als zunächst geplant. Die Zellmontage soll erst in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2027 starten, statt bereits Ende 2026. Aber der Zeitplan für die Großbaustelle verzögert sich. (Archivbild) © Christian Charisius/dpa Anfang des Jahres hatte die EU-Kommission Fördermittel und Garantien für das Milliarden-Projekt in Heide über 902 Millionen Euro genehmigt. Der Bund und das Land Schleswig-Holstein unterstützen den Bau der Batteriefabrik mit rund 700 Millionen Euro. Hinzu kommen mögliche Garantien über weitere 202 Millionen Euro. Eine Verwaltungsvereinbarung sieht vor, dass zunächst die Landesmittel in Höhe von 137 Millionen Euro fließen sollen. Das ist bislang aber nicht der Fall gewesen. Auf den Bund entfallen etwa 564 Millionen. Schleswig-Holstein in Sorge um Northvolt: Bauarbeiten in Heide sollen aber weiterlaufen Der Batteriehersteller verwies darauf, dass der Bau in Norddeutschland im gemeinsam mit Bundes- und Landesregierung festgelegten Zeitplan liege. „Es wurden bisher keine Fördermittel in Anspruch genommen, und Northvolt Germany wird, solange die Restrukturierung der Muttergesellschaft andauert, auch weiterhin keine Mittel abrufen.“ Schleswig-Holsteins Staatskanzleichef Dirk Schrödter (CDU) sieht Chancen für einen Restrukturierungsplan gemeinsam mit den Gläubigern. Es sei bedauerlich, dass noch keine gesicherte Finanzierung für den Mutterkonzern in Schweden gelungen sei, sagte Schrödter. „Es ist gut, dass nach den Diskussionen der letzten Wochen jetzt Klarheit über das weitere Verfahren und die nächsten Schritte herrscht.“ „Es ist gut, dass die Bauarbeiten in Heide weiterlaufen und nun konkrete Aussagen zum Zeitplan getroffen wurden“, sagte Schrödter. Das Land werde alle förderrechtlichen Fragen gemeinsam mit dem Bund prüfen. „Fragen betreffend etwaige Risiken für den Bund und das Land werden derzeit eingehend mit dem Bund besprochen und bewertet, über die Risikoposition des Bundes und des Landes hinsichtlich der Wandelanleihe kann somit derzeit noch keine Aussage getroffen werden, da das Verfahren unter Chapter 11 erst beginnt“, erklärte Schrödter.

Ferrari has hydrogen and Lamborghini is full electric…but this car has shocked the world,"It’s been a well-kept secret, but it seems the cat is out of the bag as Jaguar shocks the world with a full electric car.",https://www.riazor.org/news/hydrogen-lamborghini-full-electric-jaguar/2010/,,2024-11-22 22:03:00,riazor,,"It’s been a well-kept secret, but it seems the cat is out of the bag as Jaguar shocks the world with a fully electric car. The imposing camouflaged sedan looks to rival the likes of Lamborghini and Maserati, among others. The United Kingdom-based carmaker has released the images. Jaguar shocks the world with fully electric car The Jaguar full electric car edition is yet to be identified as far as its model but some reviewers say it will be called I-type. The full EV car plans to shake the market as it looks to rival top-of-the-range cars such as Maserati and Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini. As imposing and massive as it is, the car is somewhere between a four-door coupe and a shooting brake, there’s no doubt this entirely camouflaged prototype is our first look at Jaguar’s future. Published by the company, the first images of the prototype car were seen undergoing test sessions in England. According to motor1.com, this will be the first in what Jaguar calls its “new species” of high-end vehicles. It will be shown on December 2 in Art Week Miami alongside three additional concept cars as part of the brand’s hard “reset.” Jaguar to transform competition in the EV space The car publication reports that the sedan carmaker is looking to transform from a “premium” brand competing with the likes of Audi and BMW, into a high-end automaker alongside alternatives like Maserati and Porsche. The technology and performance will improve, and the price, as expected, will go up. Initial costs will be somewhere in the $130,000 to $140,000 mark. Arguably even more important, though, will be the brand’s design revolution. The car boasts a substantial presence on the road. “In terms of proportions, it is very far from what we do today. To get there, I divided the design team into three groups. Within three months they produced 17 full-size models with different design languages, some were familiar, others looked like something out of science fiction movies,” reports motor1. “The design language we chose is exuberant. Just think of something that will be different on the road. And in December we will unveil our new design language. “The photos suggest the final product of the car will have a very long nose and an incredibly high beltline. And even though it has a “grille,” this car will be 100% electric—so it’s mostly for show.” Will the new Jaguar be called an I-type? Caranddriver reports that a recent U.S. trademark application indicates that they could be I-type—this makes sense given that Jaguar’s first EV effort was branded I-Place. While that Jaguar SUV model’s production abruptly ended in 2024, and while it made a splash when it debuted, its 240-mile driving range meant it lagged behind newer rivals in recent years. What will the Jaguar I-type offer? Based on speculation from car review gurus and publications, the imposing car will come with unique features. “Whether or not it gets the name I-type, the new model should offer at least 300 miles of driving per charge, and we suspect it will come with two motors and offer all-wheel drive,” writes Drew Dorian. “Jaguar hasn’t commented on the powertrain specs, but we know the car will ride on a new electrical architecture. “Pricing is also unknown, but given Jaguar’s ambitions to move upmarket, we think the I-type will likely require a six-figure outlay.” Even though it’s still camouflaged, Jaguar’s first high-end EV already looks promising. The big question is: Will it compete against the industry’s big guns, only time will tell once the car hits the market.",Uncategorized,bing

CNBC Make It offers a handy loan calculator that can help you see how much you will pay monthly, how long it will take to pay off the debt and how much you'll pay in interest. What are auto loans and how do they work? An auto loan is a form of debt you can borrow specifically for purchasing a car. It's a form of installment debt, which means you'll pay back the balance in small, fixed increments each month over a specified period of time. Interest also gets tacked onto the monthly payments. What are the different ways to get an auto loan? There are three main ways you can get an auto loan: Dealer financing, or when the dealer partners with a financial institution to issue you a loan. While it can be convenient to buy your car and get your financing from the same place, this option usually leads to higher interest rates vs. getting a loan on your own. Applying for a loan with your bank or credit union. With a traditional bank or credit union, it can take a couple of business days to get approval and funding. An online auto loan lender. Some online lenders can offer more flexibility in terms of your credit score and approval speed than traditional banks. What is the smartest way to finance a car? When financing a car, you want to make sure you get the best terms your financial and credit situation can get you. First, remember that the best deals are reserved for those with high credit scores. If your credit could use some work, it might be a good idea to take time to improve your scores before shopping for a car. Another thing you might want to think about in advance is the down payment. Putting more money down can allow you to lower your monthly payments and interest charges, shorten the loan and even get better rates. The best practice is to put 20% down on a new car or 10% on a used car. Additionally, make sure to shop around for lower interest rates. The lower rate you get, the less you'll pay in interest charges over the life of the loan. This can lead to thousands of dollars in savings. Don't worry about the impact multiple hard inquiries will have on your credit: Most credit scoring models will count car financing inquiries made within 14 to 45 days of each other as one. Further, get the shortest loan term length you can fit into your budget. A longer-term length means more interest paid over the life of the loan. Plus, many financial institutions will give you a higher interest rate to begin with for choosing a longer loan. What factors help determine your auto loan's interest rate? Lenders use several factors to determine the interest rate to give you on an auto loan. Credit score: This is one of the most important factors since it paints a picture of your creditworthiness — or how likely you are to repay the loan in full. A higher credit score means you may qualify for some of the lower interest rates. Loan-to-value ratio: This refers to how much of a down payment you plan to make on the vehicle compared to the loan amount you're borrowing. A higher loan-to-value ratio means that you'll have significantly more debt than equity in the vehicle. Generally, higher loan-to-value ratios are considered riskier so you may be on the hook for higher interest rates. Debt-to-income ratio (DTI): As with any other form of credit, lenders also weigh the amount of debt you have in relation to your income. Generally, a lower DTI helps qualify you for lower rates. Vehicle age: Purchasing an older car can mean higher interest rates. This is because older cars can have a greater chance of needing to need costly repairs, which means more risk for the lender. How to choose an auto loan When you're considering a loan, pay close attention to the following: APR: A high interest rate can add thousands of dollars to what you pay over the loan's lifetime. In general, the higher your credit score the better your chances of getting approved for a lower APR, so try to improve your score before applying. Term length: A longer term length can mean smaller monthly payments, but you’ll pay more in interest over the loan's lifetime. On the flip side, shorter term lengths can mean larger monthly payments and less interest over the life of the loan. Down payment: Usually bigger down payments lead to lower APRs, plus you'll likely have a lower monthly payment since you've borrowed less money. Typically you want to put down between 10% and 20% for an auto loan, but this depends on how much you can afford. Monthly payment: Your monthly payment should consist of your loan principal and interest for that month. In some cases, it can also include any late fees you might’ve incurred. A lower monthly payment is usually better for your finances, but if your auto loan has a high APR, it may make sense to increase your payments to prioritize getting rid of your high-interest debt. What is a good down payment for an auto loan? It can be common for auto loan lenders to require a down payment equivalent to a certain percentage of the vehicle price, but not always. In general, a higher down payment can help you qualify for a lower interest rate with your auto loan, and can also bring down your monthly payment. Sources often recommend aiming for an upfront payment between 10% and 20% of the vehicle price. FAQs What credit score is needed to buy a car? To get the most favorable financing terms when buying a car, you'll need at least good or excellent credit — a credit score of 670 and greater. That said, it's not impossible to get approved for a car loan even with bad credit as specific requirements vary by lender. Can I negotiate my rate on an auto loan? You generally can (and should) negotiate interest rates when shopping for a car loan since the rate the dealership gives you can be higher than what the lender proposed, leaving room for negotiation. Why would a bank deny a car loan? There are a few reasons a financial institution can reject your auto loan application, including a low credit score, a high debt-to-income ratio or not enough verifiable income. What is a good car loan interest rate? A good car loan interest rate will depend on what you're willing to pay in interest. Auto loan rates are influenced by the benchmark rate set by the Federal Reserve. Having a high credit score and healthy finances will help give you the best chance at qualifying for a low rate.

To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

How Utah's electric vehicle charging prices compare to the rest of the US,"Utah's gas prices are a slightly higher than the national average, but new data shows it has some of the lowest electric vehicle recharging prices.",https://www.ksl.com/article/51195478/how-utahs-electric-vehicle-charging-prices-compare-to-the-rest-of-the-us,,2024-11-22 13:36:00,KSL,,"Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes SALT LAKE CITY — At $3.11 per gallon, Utah's average cost for regular gasoline is one of the more expensive in the U.S. a week before Thanksgiving, about a nickel higher than the national average, according to AAA. However, with an average of about $0.29 per kilowatt-hour, the organization says the Beehive State is home to some of the cheapest electric vehicle prices in the nation right now. AAA announced Thursday that it will now track electric vehicle charging costs as part of its fuel price index in response to a growing demand in the market. ""With nearly 2 million members living in households with one or more electric vehicles, AAA recognizes the need to track the average kilowatt-per-hour cost for all levels of public charging by state,"" officials wrote in a statement. The national average debuted at about $0.35 per kilowatt-hour, making Utah's average roughly a nickel per kilowatt-hour lower than the average. Only Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Texas have lower rates in the inaugural report, while Hawaii, West Virginia, Montana, New Hampshire and Arkansas have the highest rates — ranging from $0.42 to $0.57 per kilowatt-hour. The scattered nature is much different from the gasoline prices right now, where the cheapest prices are centered across the lower Midwest and most of the Southeast. The highest gasoline prices are centered across the West and Northeast right now. Additional data shows which states have the most public electric vehicle charging stations. Utah's average is based on a review of the costs at 544 public charging stations scattered across the state, which makes it 21st in terms of available charging stations for anyone to access. There were a little over 37,000 electric vehicles and 76,000 hybrid vehicles registered in Utah this year, according to the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles. The number of electric vehicles alone is nearly seven times higher than what the agency reported five years ago. Meanwhile, the number of public charging stations in U.S. states is fairly close to the country's population leaders, as one would suspect. However, it also indicates which states have jumped onto the electric vehicle trend faster than others. California leads the nation with over 11,300 stations, nearly double any other state. New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas round out the top five. Wyoming and North Dakota are the only states with fewer than 20 public stations, at least at the time of the first report. Alaska, Montana and Louisana round out the bottom five in access. Of course, many more are on the way in Utah and across the West. Charge West, a project aiming to add stretches of electric vehicle charging stations across rural highways across Utah, as well as Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming, picked up last month. ""(It) will revolutionize electric transportation in the West,"" Tammie Bostick, director of Utah Clean Cities and lead of the Charge West project, said as it launched.",Uncategorized,bing
