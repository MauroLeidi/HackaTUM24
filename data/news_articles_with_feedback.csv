Why J.D. Power is Predicting the Dodge Charger Daytona EV will Have Great Long Term Value,"The Dodge Charger Daytona, Jeep Gladiator and Jeep Wagoneer all earned J.D. Power 2025 US ALG Residual Value Awards.",https://www.torquenews.com/3768/why-jd-power-predicting-dodge-charger-daytona-ev-will-have-great-long-term-value,,2024-11-23 16:53:00,Torque News,,"Follow us today... It is interesting that J.D. Power is giving the 2024 Dodge Daytona Charger EV its J.D. Power 2025 U.S. ALG Residual Value Award in the electric vehicle segment. The Charger EV isn’t even out yet, but the auto experts are expecting great things from the new vehicle. The Charger EV will be Dodge’s first EV. The Jeep Gladiator ranks No. 1 for residual value among midsize pickups. The Jeep Wagoneer earns award for best residual value among large SUVs for third consecutive year. Why J.D. Power is Ranking the Dodge Charger Daytona #1 The J.D. Power annual award projects which vehicle models will hold the highest percentage of their manufacturer’s suggested retail price following a three-year period of ownership. The first edition of any vehicle is often a collector’s edition but J.D Power is banking on the Charger EV holding its value as well as the gas-powered versions do. ""The last-generation Dodge Charger won ALG Residual Value Awards for eight consecutive years, from 2015 to 2022, and this next generation is picking up right where it left off, winning its segment."" said Matt Thompson, head of U.S. retail sales, Stellantis North America. ""The brand-new Dodge Charger Daytona showcases the future of muscle cars, bringing together the instant torque and fun of an electric car with the unmistakable muscle car styling and heritage of a Dodge Charger. Strong performance, competitive pricing and unmistakable styling make it the winner of the Electric Car segment.” said Danny Battaglia, managing director of ALG customer success at J.D. Power. The 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona EV The 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack will keep Dodge’s title as the world’s quickest and most powerful muscle car with 670 horsepower and 627 lb.-ft. of torque. The Dodge Charger Daytona will have an all-electric, 400-volt dual motor system, delivering high-horsepower performance through standard all-wheel drive. The Dodge Charger Daytona is an interesting experiment because Dodge has created a special Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust system to replicate a muscle car sound for the EV. Current and previous generations of muscle cars were defined by the loud revving engines. Dodge realized right away that to be a muscle car, an EV needed an identifiable engine rumble. I have covered the evolution of the EV muscle car since Dodge first proposed it two years ago. The Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack with its 670 horsepower will have an astounding 627 lb.-ft. of torque. The Scat Pack version reaches 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds while running the quarter-mile in an estimated 11.5 seconds. The Dodge Charger Daytona R/T model will kick out 496 horsepower and 404 lb.-ft. of torque. The all-electric two-door Charger Daytona models are part of the Charger’s multi-energy lineup, which will include all-electric four-door Charger Daytona models as well as gas-powered Dodge Charger SIXPACK H.O. and Charger SIXPACK S.O. vehicles. Jeep Gladiator and Jeep Wagoneer Also Receive Top Residual Value Awards The Jeep Gladiator ranks No. 1 for residual value among midsize pickups, marking the third time Gladiator has earned a J.D. Power award. The Jeep Wagoneer also takes home the award for best residual value among large SUVs for third consecutive year. Matt Thompson, head of U.S. retail sales, Stellantis North America, praised both vehicles. ""Additionally, the Jeep brand is celebrating a three-peat for the Jeep Wagoneer, now the most affordable full-size SUV in America, and the Gladiator, which remains the only pickup truck in the industry with open-air freedom, featuring a folding windshield, three removable roof choices and removable doors."" Danny Battaglia, managing director of ALG customer success at J.D. Power, added, ""Jeep Wagoneer delivers the iconic Jeep design characteristics in conjunction with an extremely competitive pricing and many luxury features. This strong value proposition helped the Wagoneer to win the Residual Value Award in the large SUVs segment. Jeep Gladiator seamlessly blends tradition and innovation. Gladiator provides the capability of a pickup, the adventure of a true off-road vehicle in a competitive price leading it to win the Residual Value Award in the midsize pickup segment.” The Jeep Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and Wagoneer L all ranked No. 2 in their catagories, while Ram ProMaster ranked second in the commercial van category.

However, the content tends to summarize known information about the vehicle's predicted value without delving deeply into new trends or broader implications for the electric vehicle market. While it does inform the audience about the award Receiver Electric Vehicles, it largely focuses on the expected values and comparisons with other vehicles, rather than presenting unique insights into broader industry trends.

The inclusion of concepts like 'muscle car sound for EVs' and comparison with traditional gasoline vehicles show some depth of knowledge in automotive trends, but the article does not delve deeply into the broader implications or benefits of EV adoption.

Power 2025 US ALG Residual Value Awards, focusing on the Dodge Charger Daytona EV and its predicted long-term value.

The focus is more on brand positioning and market expectations rather than emerging opportunities or solutions. The inclusion of the Jeep Gladiator and Wagoneer awards adds context but detracts from the exploration of contemporary EV issues.

In terms of sourcing, the article relies heavily on statements from industry insiders, specifically from Stellantis North America, and lacks independent verification or a broader range of expert opinions, which would enhance its reliability and depth. Additionally, there is minimal discussion on emerging innovations like advancements in battery technology or charging infrastructure that are crucial to assessing the future of electric vehicles.

There is a mix of technical specifications and industry context which can engage both potential e-vehicle buyers and enthusiasts following auto industry developments. However, the article could benefit from more explicit headings to enhance navigation through the different topics discussed.

However, the article lacks detailed technical insights into the Charger Daytona's electric vehicle technology, safety features, and market trends beyond the residual value predictions. The piece qualifies the Charger Daytona as the next big thing based on historical data of past models and statements from industry representatives, but this does not provide comprehensive evidence on the technological aptitude or market positioning of the new EV.

Jaguar’s new logo and branding marking a new era in the luxury electric vehicle market,"British automaker Jaguar, under Tata Motors, is going all-electric with a fresh logo, branding, and three new EVs by 2026.

Will Jaguar’s new badge design lead the way for luxury electric vehicles? Why Jaguar’s rebranding aims to double prices and attract younger buyers? Jaguar to launch three new electric models by 2026 with advanced features How Jaguar is transforming the ownership experience for luxury electric vehicle buyers? Why has Jaguar's rebranding has sparked scepticism on social media? Jaguar aims to redefine luxury EVs and compete with Rolls-Royce and Bentley What to expect from Jaguar’s upcoming brand unveiling at Miami Art Week? Jaguar, the iconic British luxury automaker owned by Tata Motors, is embarking on a bold transformation as it shifts to an all-electric future. With a commitment to reinventing itself, Jaguar has unveiled a new logo and branding that emphasises its dedication to originality, luxury, and modernity. The rebranding includes a new ""Leaper"" cat emblem, updated typography, and dynamic marketing slogans designed to resonate with a younger, wealthier audience. As the company prepares to launch three new electric vehicles by 2026, Jaguar aims to redefine the luxury EV market, positioning itself alongside top-tier brands like Rolls-Royce and Bentley.As part of its major rebranding initiative, Jaguar introduced a completely redesigned logo and visual identity to reflect the brand's transformation into a luxury electric vehicle maker. The new logo features a distinctive blend of uppercase and lowercase letters, a design choice that Jaguar believes creates visual harmony. This updated typography reflects the company's evolution, aiming to modernise its image while preserving its premium heritage. One key aspect of the rebranding is the emphasis on the British pronunciation of ""Jag-you-are,"" shifting away from the American ""Jag-wahr."" Jaguar believes the latter doesn't capture the sophistication or luxury that the brand embodies.In addition to the new typography, Jaguar also revamped its iconic ""Leaper"" logo—the prancing cat symbol that has been a hallmark of the brand for decades. The updated Leaper is more angular and dynamic, symbolising the company’s forward-looking, modern identity. While it retains the essence of the original, this new version signifies Jaguar's focus on innovation and contemporary luxury, making it more fitting for the brand's electric future while still honouring its legacy of high-end performance and elegance.Jaguar’s marketing slogans—“delete ordinary,” “live vivid,” and “copy nothing”—serve as powerful statements of the brand’s intention to differentiate itself from the competition and establish itself as a leader in originality and creativity. These phrases reflect the company’s desire to move away from traditional, conventional design practices and mass-market strategies, focusing instead on producing truly unique, innovative products. By using these bold slogans, Jaguar is signalling its commitment to breaking away from the status quo and embracing a more forward-thinking approach in the luxury electric vehicle market.The emphasis on “delete ordinary” and “copy nothing” shows Jaguar's rejection of generic, mass-produced designs in favour of one-of-a-kind, meticulously crafted vehicles. The slogan “live vivid” further enhances this vision, encouraging customers to embrace bold, exciting choices that stand out in the automotive world. Together, these slogans not only highlight Jaguar’s shift toward a more distinct and exclusive identity but also target a modern, discerning audience that values uniqueness, innovation, and high-end experiences in both the products they buy and the brands they engage with. The new brand message reflects Jaguar’s ambition to capture the attention of a younger, affluent demographic that seeks originality and luxury.As part of Jaguar's rebranding efforts, the brand has significantly updated its emblem to align with its new identity as a luxury electric vehicle maker. The iconic Jaguar face logo, which has been a staple on the grilles of Jaguar cars for the past two decades, has been replaced with a more modern and minimalist circular badge. This new badge features a stylized “J” and “r,” reflecting a cleaner, contemporary look while still maintaining the brand's luxurious appeal. The brass-coloured letters stand out against a gold-and-white backdrop, emphasising sophistication and refinement.In addition to the updated logo, Jaguar’s new badge design is further enhanced by a bold new colour palette. The introduction of primary colours like red, blue, and yellow is a deliberate choice, intended to convey the brand's emphasis on exuberance, creativity, and originality. These colours are meant to evoke a sense of energy and innovation, reflecting Jaguar’s shift towards a more dynamic, modern, and forward-thinking image. The redesigned badge not only symbolises the brand's transition but also positions Jaguar as a distinctive player in the luxury EV market, differentiating itself from traditional automotive designs with a strong visual identity.Jaguar's rebranding signals a decisive shift from offering mass-market luxury vehicles to positioning itself as an ultra-premium electric vehicle (EV) brand. Recognizing that its past products, though high-quality, struggled to stand out in an increasingly crowded market dominated by competitors like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar is now recalibrating its approach. The company is moving toward producing “spectacular” vehicles that will appeal to a more exclusive, affluent audience. These new EVs are expected to be priced at roughly double the cost of current models, targeting younger, wealthier buyers who value emotional connections with the brand and its design, rather than simply technical specifications. This move reflects Jaguar’s ambition to redefine luxury and innovation, aiming to attract a new generation of customers looking for distinctiveness, quality, and a deeper brand experience.Jaguar has announced that it will launch three new electric models by 2026. These new models will be designed on a new electric platform and will include significant technological advancements. One of the most anticipated features is a claimed range of up to 430 miles per charge, with the ability to add 200 miles of range in just 15 minutes using a Level 3 fast charger. Furthermore, Jaguar’s electric cars will be compatible with Tesla’s Supercharger network, eliminating the need for a separate adapter, which will make long-distance travel more convenient.In terms of design, Jaguar is positioning its upcoming electric vehicles as a departure from the homogeneity currently seen in the electric vehicle market. The company intends to counteract the common ""aerodynamic blob"" design seen in many EVs by creating low-slung, elegant cars with elongated proportions that evoke the luxury sedans of the past. The first vehicle to showcase this design will be a four-door grand tourer, which will be unveiled at Miami Art Week on December 2, 2024.Jaguar's shift to an electric future is also accompanied by a focus on improving the overall brand experience, including the purchasing process and ownership journey. The company plans to streamline the car-buying process through a new digital ecosystem that will allow customers to configure and order their vehicles online. However, in the U.S., customers will still need to complete the purchase in person, reflecting Jaguar's emphasis on providing a luxury experience at every stage of the process.Jaguar also plans to open exclusive brand experience centres in luxury districts in major cities, beginning with Paris. These spaces will not only serve as retail locations but will also provide customers with a premium experience that reflects the values of the brand.While Jaguar’s rebranding has been met with enthusiasm within the company, social media reactions have been more sceptical. Some users questioned the decision to focus so heavily on the brand’s visual identity without showcasing actual cars in the promotional materials. Others criticized the lengthy rebranding process, with one user sarcastically asking, “Is this for fashion?” Jaguar’s official response to such queries has been that the rebranding represents a “declaration of intent” and that the physical manifestation of their new identity will be unveiled soon.Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk chimed in, asking if Jaguar still sold cars, to which the brand’s social media team responded playfully, inviting him to see the new vehicles at the upcoming Miami event. While the rebranding has sparked confusion for some, Jaguar remains confident that this transformation is essential for the brand’s future.Jaguar is positioning itself to compete with the most exclusive luxury brands in the world, such as Rolls-Royce and Bentley. By focusing on the luxury EV market and eliminating lower-tier models, the company aims to appeal to the ultra-high-end consumer. This new direction is a radical departure from the past, and Jaguar hopes to redefine what it means to own a luxury vehicle in the electric age.Jaguar’s rebranding and transition to electric vehicles are still works in progress, but the upcoming unveiling of the first physical manifestation of its new brand identity at Miami Art Week on December 2, 2024, will offer a glimpse into the future of the iconic automaker. The new electric car, along with the revamped brand, aims to solidify Jaguar’s position as a leader in the luxury electric vehicle market.While questions about the technical aspects of Jaguar’s upcoming electric vehicles remain, the new logos, design ethos, and exclusive positioning provide a clearer sense of where the brand is headed.

Simon Harris's party will commit to the new scheme to replace petrol and diesel vehicles with electric vehicles, providing major cash benefits for those who take part in the scheme. Ruairi Quinn, the former finance minister of the Labour Party, had previously implemented a Government-backed scrappage scheme, but this was before the electric vehicles became mainstream. Alan Farrell TD, Dublin Fingal East candidate, said: ""We have had scrappage schemes before and they have worked in changing behaviours. ""We want more people to use electric vehicles and we know people want to use them more. But they are expensive for a lot of people."" He added that if Fine Gael were put back into the government by the people, they would look into the introduction of the new scheme, starting with replacing older and polluting vehicles with electric vehicles. It is also believed that old motorbikes and scooters will benefit from the new scheme, replacing it with non-polluting electric bikes. The party also mentioned that it would transform public transport, starting with buses, to promote a cleaner transport system by eliminating the use of petrol and diesel. As part of the new scheme, Fine Gael also promises to increase the number of publicly available EV charging points to nearly 10,000 charging stations, providing better coverage of EVs nationwide. 'Our people are suffering', cries emotional woman as she confronts Simon Harris while canvassing for Govt doing 'nothing' They will also review custom duties on second-hand EV imports, making it affordable for electric vehicle owners. The government first established a goal of having 175,000 electric cars on the road by the end of the following year, which would increase to 845,000 by the end of 2030, as part of the Climate Action Plan. 'MAKING GOOD PROGRESS' Mr Farrell added: ""We are making good progress on meeting our 2025 target but we have to make sure we can help make through the climate transition. ""The world is on fire and we have to ensure we take the necessary steps to help people with the change. We are doing that through the retrofitting grants and helping people make their homes warmer. ""We are also doing it through reduced public transport fees to encourage more people taking the bus or train to work."" Additionally, he disclosed that Fine Gael is matching the current cycle-to-Work program for employees by committing to a Bike-to-College program to assist students with the cost of a new cycle. He added: ""We believe these practical measures can help move the dial."" The Green Party is expected to meet the pledges with scepticism.

The Carlsbad, California-based startup is a pioneering venture aimed at designing and creating solar-powered vehicles that can, as the company states, ""handle most daily driving needs completely off the grid."" Recently, the company revealed its first-ever production-intent build that showcased actual components for the flagship solar EV, as Electrek detailed. Despite the company's loyal and excited following, Aptera Motors needs more funding to reach official production. Advertisement Advertisement Co-CEOs Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony have hinted that the company needs $60 million in additional funding to jumpstart low-volume SEV production, according to Electrek. To raise funds, Aptera reached out to the financial group U.S. Capital Global. Since July, U.S. Capital Global has been heading the $60 million sale of convertible notes. While executives at U.S. Capital thought the raise would take 60-90 days, as of late October, they had only $400,000. The Aptera CEOs believe that is mainly the result of the high minimum investment price.

Department for Transport figures show there were 179 public electric car chargers in Dudley as of July – down from 198 the year before. It means the number of public chargers has fallen by - 10 per cent over the last year. The Government set a target of installing 300,000 public electric chargers by 2030, meaning around 3,600 chargers must be installed across the UK per month. Of the chargers installed in Dudley, 69 were rapid chargers. Nationally, 65,000 chargers had been installed as of July – a rise of 47 per cent on the year before. It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target. But the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000. There were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley. Meanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally. RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: ""It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."" He said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are ""non-existent in many other parts of the country"", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital. ""Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat,"" he added. ""Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority.""

It's just one of the reasons why the EV car market may soon finally take off here. MANILA, Philippines – For the first time in Philippine history, Vietnamese cars are now being sold in the country, a sign of how our once-backward, war-torn neighbor has overtaken us economically. Vietnam’s Vingroup launched its VinFast electric vehicles (EVs) in the Philippines on May 31 at the SM Mall of Asia, complete with authentic Vietnamese coffee for the guests. It has opened three dealerships in the capital region — in ASEANA, Parañaque City; EDSA, Mandaluyong City; and in Alabang, Muntinlupa City. VinFast, one of 100 companies on TIME Magazine‘s Most Influential Companies in 2024, touts itself as a “global smart EV company that accelerates the EV evolution.” “The grand opening of VinFast’s first three dealerships in the Philippines marks a significant milestone in our journey to conquer the potential electric vehicle market here,” said Nguyen Thi Minh Ngoc, CEO of VinFast Philippines. But that’s not all. Perhaps for the first time, too, a car is being sold in the Philippines via live selling, now a popular way of selling goods in the country via e-commerce. VinFast has held three live selling sessions for its eye-catching VF 3 model, with the fourth scheduled on Monday, November 25. Its first-ever live selling was held on October 28, which got over 450 comments, mostly inquiries about available colors and charging time, among others. “This is wild. Car live selling,” said netizen Jayvee Fernandez. “Selling cars like cellphones.” “Soo cuuutee,” said Celle Repato of the yellow VF 3 model that was used for the live selling. “Adorable,” said another netizen, with others asking for the other colors available. It’s this kind of marketing campaign that has made VinFast the best-selling automotive brand in Vietnam after selling over 51,000 EVs this year. Its VF 3 model sold fast via a pre-order campaign considered by marketing analysts to be the “most successful” in Vietnam’s history. PINK.

VinFast VF 3 sells for P645,000. It’s not the cheapest car of its size in the whole market of small cars (including internal combustion engines or ICE cars) in the Philippines — Toyota’s Wigo and Suzuki’s Dzire, for instance, retail for P609,000 — but the chance of getting a car that’s exempted from coding in Metro Manila (all EV cars are exempted under existing rules) is a definite edge. Another eye candy similar to VinFast’s VF 3 is Bestune Philippines’ Pony. It claims to be the most affordable mini-EV in the market with a retail price of P588,000. Bestune is a subsidiary brand of China’s First Automotive Works. LITTLE PONY.

Total Philippine electrified vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2024 reached 14,178, a 133% increase from the 6,088 in the third quarter of 2023, according to data from the latest earnings report of industry leader Toyota Motors Philippines (TMP) released last week. In 2019 or five years ago, only 214 EV cars were sold in the country. It went up to 378 units in 2020, 843 units in 2021, and 3,091 units in 2022, according to the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry or CREVI. The roadmap sets a 50% EV fleet share in the Philippines by 2040. In the short term (2023 to 2028), the target is to have 2.45 million electric vehicles (cars, tricycles, motorcycles, buses, and public utility vehicles) by 2028. For cars, the targets are 415,000 Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), 69,000 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and 69,000 Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Image from Department of Energy’s Comprehensive Roadmap for the Electric Vehicle Industry, 2022. “Electrified vehicles continue to gain further traction supported by TMP’s wide and diverse model offerings and implementation of EO [Executive Order No.] 62,” said Toyota Motors Philippines’ parent, Ty family-led GT Capital Holdings Corporation, on November 14. EO 62, which took effect last July, expanded import duty exemption (zero tariffs) to all three types of electrified vehicles — BEVs, PHEVs, and HEVs — until 2028. Toyota Motors Philippines dominates the electrified vehicle car market in the Philippines with a market share of over 72% in the third quarter of 2024. Toyota’s HEV sales grew 186% year-on-year, while luxury sister brand Lexus’ electrified vehicle sales grew 69%. Toyota Motors Philippines sold 8,441 HEVs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,944 units in the same period in 2023. Among its HEVs are the Camry, Corolla Altis, Corolla, Cross, Rav4, Yaris Cross, Alphard, and Zenix. It launched its best-selling Toyota Prius in the Philippines in 2009 or 15 years ago. Play Video Toyota’s HEV combines internal combustion engines with its “electronically controlled brake system” or ECB. When brakes are applied, kinetic energy recharges the electric motor’s battery. This hybrid system eliminates the need for plugging in. Charging stations When asked whether the Philippines’ electrified vehicle market has finally taken off, Energy Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said in a public forum on Wednesday, November 20: “The answer is yes. Because if you compare the sales of EV from last year to this year, I think it either doubled or tripled. So, it was slow, but it’s getting there.” She said the tax perks granted to EV cars have contributed to the nascent growth of the industry. It’s not just VinFast that’s seeing the opportunity to make money in the Philippines — so is American tycoon Elon Musk. His electric vehicle company Tesla opened its first showroom in the Philippines two weeks ago, with its Model 3 and Model Y retailing at P2.109 million and P2.369 million, respectively. Although the electrified vehicle industry in the Philippines is still very much in its infancy, the entry of low-cost electrified vehicles, mainly from China and Vietnam, could lead to a boom in the coming years. Carla Buencamino, head of mobility infra of ACMobility, said on Friday, November 22, that while the Philippines’ EV industry is still in its nascent stages, it is growing. ACMobility has partnered with BYD, the global leader in EV, in selling BYD EVs in the Philippines. She told ABS-CBN News Channel’s Market Edge that ACMobility is committed to setting up more charging stations in the country, which is crucial to getting consumers to adopt EVs. PLUG. More EV charging stations, such as this one in Estancia Mall, Pasig City, will help convince more car buyers to shift to EVs. Photo by Isagani de Castro Jr./Rappler For cars, Buencamino said the DOE roadmap’s target is 7,000 charged points in 2028, from only 700 in October 2024. “There’s a long way to go, but ACMobility is committed to building this infrastructure,” she said. Similarly, Edmund Araga, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippine, said in October at the 12th Philippine Electric Vehicle Summit that the Philippines still has “a long way to go to achieving the industry goal of selling 2.5 million EVs and opening up to [over] 65,000 EV charging stations nationwide by 2028.” He has welcomed, however, the high interest of Filipinos in shifting to EVs. A market research in 2018 by Frost and Sullivan showed 46% of Filipino consumers are open to buying an EV as their next vehicle, the highest among six countries in the ASEAN region.

Jetzt ist das Unternehmen jedoch zahlungsunfähig. Welche Auswirkungen hat das auf das Bauprojekt? Update vom 22. November, 11:30 Uhr: Nach dem Antrag des finanziell angeschlagenen schwedischen Batterieherstellers Northvolt auf Gläubigerschutz in den USA ist Firmenchef Peter Carlsson zurückgetreten. Er bleibe dem Unternehmen aber als Mitglied des Aufsichtsrates sowie als führender Berater erhalten, teilte Northvolt in Stockholm mit. Carlsson führte Northvolt seit der Firmengründung im Jahr 2016 und zählt zu den Mitgründern des Unternehmens. Peter Carlsson hat seinen Rücktritt als Northvolt-Chef angekündigt. (Archivbild) © Marcus Brandt/dpa Erstmeldung vom 22. November, 8:30 Uhr: Stockholm/Heide – Die Krise in der Automobilindustrie hat Folgen für die ganze Lieferkette. Für Elektroautos bedeutet das unweigerlich die Batterien, bei denen Europa ohnehin schwächer dasteht als die Konkurrenz aus China. Das schwedische Unternehmen Northvolt sollte das ändern und zu Europas wichtigstem Batterieproduzenten wachsen. Dieses Vorhaben erhält nun einen Rückschlag: Die Firma ist insolvent. Northvolt meldet Insolvenz an: Batteriehersteller hat Milliarden-Schulden Der angeschlagene schwedische Batteriehersteller Northvolt hat Gläubigerschutz nach US-Recht beantragt und sucht nun nach einem weiteren Investor. Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag (21. November) mit. Das Sanierungsverfahren nach Kapitel 11 (Chapter 11) des US-Insolvenzrechts schützt Northvolt für eine gewisse Zeit vor dem Zugriff seiner Gläubiger und erleichtert damit den finanziellen Neustart. „Das über allem stehende Ziel ist es, mit einem oder mehreren langfristigen strategischen oder Finanzinvestoren zusammenzuarbeiten“, hieß es in den Gerichtsunterlagen. Zugleich erhält das Unternehmen Zugriff auf 245 Millionen Dollar und kann damit sein Überleben in den kommenden Wochen gewährleisten. Der Schritt, in den USA Gläubigerschutz zu suchen, kommt nicht überraschend: Die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters hatte vergangenen Freitag unter Berufung auf Insider gemeldet, dass Northvolt den Schritt in Betracht ziehe. Northvolt verfügt den Gerichtsunterlagen zufolge derzeit nur noch über flüssige Mittel von 30 Millionen Dollar – das reicht den Angaben nach gerade noch für eine Woche. Zugleich liegt der Schuldenberg inzwischen bei 5,8 Milliarden Dollar. Das Unternehmen hatte in den vergangenen Monaten mit seinen Geldgebern über ein Finanzierungspaket verhandelt, allerdings ohne Erfolg. Insolvenz von schwedischem Batteriehersteller: Volkswagen ist größter Anteilseigner Nun stellt der schwedische Lkw-Hersteller Scania Northvolt ein Darlehen in Höhe von 100 Millionen Dollar zur Verfügung. Damit solle die Herstellung von Batteriezellen für E-Fahrzeuge im nordschwedischen Skelleftea unterstützt werden. Scania bezieht schon jetzt Batterien von Northvolt. Die weiteren 145 Millionen Dollar sind Mittel von Northvolt, die bislang als Sicherheiten zurückgelegt wurden. Der größte Anteilseigner ist Volkswagen, auch die US-Investmentbank Goldman Sachs und BMW gehören zu den Eigentümern. BMW und Goldman Sachs lehnten eine Stellungnahme ab. Volkswagen erklärte am Abend, man stehe mit Northvolt in engem Kontakt. Die vom Northvolt-Mitbegründer Harald Mix geleitete Investmentgruppe Vargas beschrieb den Schritt als notwendig, um die Kapitalstruktur zu stärken. Gleichzeitig könne das Unternehmen den Betrieb aufrechterhalten, sich auf die Steigerung der Fertigungszahlen konzentrieren und die Kosten senken. Man sei überzeugt, dass Northvolt diese Zeit durchstehen werde. Northvolt selbst erklärte, das Unternehmen erwarte, die Restrukturierung bis zum ersten Quartal 2025 abzuschließen. Solange werde der Betrieb wie gehabt weitergehen. BMW zog Mega-Deal mit Northvolt zurück – Northvolt-Insolvenz ist Rückschlag für die Branche Der Batteriehersteller benötigt derzeit dringend Geld und arbeitet seit mehreren Wochen mit seinen Investoren an einem Rettungspaket. Die schwedische Regierung hatte jüngst erklärt, keine Anteile von Northvolt übernehmen zu wollen. Northvolt hat noch nie einen Gewinn erwirtschaftet und kämpft mit Qualitätsproblemen und Verzögerungen. Im Juni zog deswegen BMW einen Auftrag mit einem Volumen von zwei Milliarden Euro zurück. Wegen wegbrechender Aufträge und Problemen beim Hochfahren der Produktion hatte der Konzern zuletzt seine Ausbaupläne massiv eingedampft, tausende Mitarbeiter entlassen und Tochtergesellschaften verkauft. Noch am Mittwoch ernannte Northvolt den Sanierungsexperten Paul O‘Donnell zum Chef seiner Hauptanlage in Nordschweden. Der Antrag auf Gläubigerschutz ist ein Rückschlag für die europäischen Bemühungen, sich mit einer eigenen Batterie-Industrie unabhängiger von chinesischen Herstellern wie CATL und BYD zu machen. Nach Daten der Internationalen Energieagentur ist 85 Prozent der Batteriezellen-Herstellung in der Volksrepublik beheimatet. Northvolt hat zwar eine Reihe von europäischen Startups bei der Investition von Milliardensummen in die Batteriefertigung angeführt. Allerdings ist die Nachfrage nicht so schnell angestiegen wie von Teilen der Branche vorhergesagt. Northvolt baut Fabrik in Deutschland: Bau wird sich wohl verzögern Noch ist nicht abzusehen, was das konkret für den Bau einer Northvolt-Gigafabrik im schleswig-holsteinischen Heide bedeutet. Das Unternehmen erklärte dazu am Abend: Die deutsche Tochter werde unabhängig von der Muttergesellschaft finanziert. „Sie ist nicht Teil des Chapter 11-Verfahrens.“ Deutschlandchef Christofer Haux sagte, „in Dithmarschen schreiten die Bauarbeiten derweil weiter voran. Der Standort genießt höchste Priorität.“ Klar ist aber bereits, die Fabrik soll später ihre Arbeit aufnehmen als zunächst geplant. Die Zellmontage soll erst in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2027 starten, statt bereits Ende 2026. Aber der Zeitplan für die Großbaustelle verzögert sich. (Archivbild) © Christian Charisius/dpa Anfang des Jahres hatte die EU-Kommission Fördermittel und Garantien für das Milliarden-Projekt in Heide über 902 Millionen Euro genehmigt. Der Bund und das Land Schleswig-Holstein unterstützen den Bau der Batteriefabrik mit rund 700 Millionen Euro. Hinzu kommen mögliche Garantien über weitere 202 Millionen Euro. Eine Verwaltungsvereinbarung sieht vor, dass zunächst die Landesmittel in Höhe von 137 Millionen Euro fließen sollen. Das ist bislang aber nicht der Fall gewesen. Auf den Bund entfallen etwa 564 Millionen. Schleswig-Holstein in Sorge um Northvolt: Bauarbeiten in Heide sollen aber weiterlaufen Der Batteriehersteller verwies darauf, dass der Bau in Norddeutschland im gemeinsam mit Bundes- und Landesregierung festgelegten Zeitplan liege. „Es wurden bisher keine Fördermittel in Anspruch genommen, und Northvolt Germany wird, solange die Restrukturierung der Muttergesellschaft andauert, auch weiterhin keine Mittel abrufen.“ Schleswig-Holsteins Staatskanzleichef Dirk Schrödter (CDU) sieht Chancen für einen Restrukturierungsplan gemeinsam mit den Gläubigern. Es sei bedauerlich, dass noch keine gesicherte Finanzierung für den Mutterkonzern in Schweden gelungen sei, sagte Schrödter. „Es ist gut, dass nach den Diskussionen der letzten Wochen jetzt Klarheit über das weitere Verfahren und die nächsten Schritte herrscht.“ „Es ist gut, dass die Bauarbeiten in Heide weiterlaufen und nun konkrete Aussagen zum Zeitplan getroffen wurden“, sagte Schrödter. Das Land werde alle förderrechtlichen Fragen gemeinsam mit dem Bund prüfen. „Fragen betreffend etwaige Risiken für den Bund und das Land werden derzeit eingehend mit dem Bund besprochen und bewertet, über die Risikoposition des Bundes und des Landes hinsichtlich der Wandelanleihe kann somit derzeit noch keine Aussage getroffen werden, da das Verfahren unter Chapter 11 erst beginnt“, erklärte Schrödter.

The recall includes certain IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 EVs along with some luxury Genesis GV60, Genesis GV70 and Genesis G80 electrified variants from model years 2022-2025. The US auto safety regulator said that integrated charging control units are likely to get damaged and stop charging the 12-volt battery, which can result in a loss of drive power.

The recall affected the 2024 Santa Fe and Santa Fe Hybrid models, as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The issue stemmed from the overhead console rear sunshade switch knob, which may not have been fully recessed, leading to unintended closure of the sunshade and increasing the likelihood of harm. Of the vehicles affected, more than 26,000 were Santa Fe models, while approximately 8,000 were Santa Fe Hybrid vehicles. Hyundai dealerships replaced the faulty knobs at no charge. This recall marked the second issue for Hyundai Santa Fe models that year. In July, the company had recalled over 12,000 vehicles due to software malfunctions that affected the transmission control unit, potentially causing the car to roll away while in park.

The two five-figure cars - a 1921 Talbot Darracq and a 1952 Mercedes Benz 220 Type A convertible - were discovered in Framlingham, Suffolk after their owner died. The white Mercedes covered in a thin veil of dust sold for £37,000 while the green Talbot bagged for £10,500. Both exceeded their estimated sale prices, with the Mercedes and Talbot valued between £30,000 to £35,000 and £6,000 to £8,000 respectively. The classic green car was originally purchased by its late owner in 1967 for £750, whilst he served in the British Army in Germany. The man had even preserved the original receipt of his beloved vehicle which had travelled with him through his time in the military. He continued to drive both antique cars up until the 1980s, but for the last four decades they remained tucked away in his barn. The two valuable vehicles were purchased at Reeman Dansie Auctions in Colchester, Essex, on November 16. This 1952 convertible Mercedes Benz 220 Type stored in a barn in Framlingham, Suffolk, fetched £10,500 at auction And the 1921 Talbot Darracq was sold for £37,000 at auction The Talbot had been purchased in 1967 for £750 - with the original receipt and cheque intact The wwo rare classic cars that were stored in a rural barn for 40 years A Reeman Dansie spokesperson said: 'The left hand drive Mercedes was originally purchased by the late owner, whilst he was serving in the British Army in Germany, with the much loved car travelling with him during his military career. 'It also saw life in Cyprus and the Middle East, before he undertook an epic journey across the continent to bring the car back to Blighty. 'The 1921 Talbot - Darracq was purchased from C. J. Bendall Ltd in Hitchin in February 1967 at a cost of £750.00. 'The original purchase receipt and cheque remains with a photograph of the late owner and his wife standing proudly beside their new purchase. 'We understand from the late owner's family that the cars were last running in the 1980s and have remained preserved in his barn for the last four decades.' The discovery of the hidden jewels comes shortly after a hoard of classic cars were found in a rural warehouse in Wales - worth an estimated £1 million. The motor graveyard, which was packed out with iconic yet rusting cars such as Bentleys, Jaguars, a Porsche and even a Rolls-Royce, were found earlier this year. But the epic treasure trove had seen better days, with many cars drowned in a veil of dust and rust, while others were missing doors and had plants growing through their mechanisms. However urban explorer, Daniel Sims, who refused to disclose the location of where he found the cars, believed their historic and sentimental value was upwards of £1million. The 35-year-old, divulged there must have been more than 100 vehicles hidden away in the building, which he has documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality. He said: 'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself. A motor graveyard filled with Rolls Royce, Jaguar and Porsche cars have been found withering away in a warehouse in Wales The collection - worth up to a staggering £1 million - is every car enthusiasts dream However many of the antique cars have seen better days with many hidden away behind plants, or gathering dust as they rot away in the warehouse 'I don't know anything about the history of the place other than whoever has been collecting these cars for decades and has an impressive collection which they must be proud of. 'The cars were visible from the roadside so once on a field it was open access as the back of the property fence had fallen down. 'We were quite nervous as we didn't know the backstory of this place apart from it containing a car graveyard with classic cars and from what we saw must have been over 100 hidden away here. 'The place itself is a little overgrown at the back with rust and decay setting into the vehicles. Some were stored away meaning the damage to these amazing vehicles was minimal which is crazy to see. 'Iconic cars such as Bentleys, Porsche, Peugeot 205 GTI , various Mercedes, MGs and quite a few imports from different countries are hidden here and would be worth a minimum from what I saw over £500,000 to £1,000,000 just off basic calculations.' Other vehicles found inside include Land Rover Defenders, Jaguars, Morris Minor 1100, a Rolls-Royce, MG MGA 1960, Mercedes-Benz, Triumph, Jaguar MK1, Mini Coopers, MG MG B, Cadillac Eldorado and a Volkswagen caddy. 'I love taking photos of different things and items and dramatic places such as this and showing how these places and items end up,' Mr Sims added. 'For a lot of people, these iconic cars will hold a lot of memories. Urban explorer Daniel Sims, made the astonishing find but is refusing to reveal the location of the warehouse for fear of attracting looters Hehas documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality - and is under the impression the loot could be worth around £1million Several Mercedes, MGs, MG Midgets, Land Rover Discoveries, Volkswagens were found among the rusting vehicles 'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself,' Mr Sims said 'There were no scary moments but we were interrupted towards the end of the exploration by some locals who were worried we could be burglars as there had been some rural crime taking place in the area recently. 'We explained how we were photographers and moved on from the area. 'Just the sheer amount of vehicles collected which is rare to see and was a real treat to see so many iconic cars collected here.' However it isn't the first time urban explorers have discovered a treasure trove of vehicles, as two upon this car graveyard that is filled with hundreds of classic motors last year. Matt, 43, from Sheffield, and Andy, 56, from Doncaster - both YouTubers - journeyed to the secretive location in Suffolk. They originally wanted to explore an abandoned house, but ended up stumbling across a huge barn and field full of classic cars. The pair documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel, FindersBeepers, where they showcased the goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and reclaimed by the earth. Matt said: 'After doing a lot of research on Google Earth, Andy came across the typical signs of an abandoned house only to go on to find a huge barn and field full of classic cars. Hoards of clutter filling one side of the barn which is packed with antique cars A micro car next to a Fiat Coupe, both of which have been left rotting away among the hidden collection located somewhere in Wales Several cars estimated to be worth thousands lined up rusting away in unison, hidden from public view A picture of the barn where the vehicles are held from the exterior 'We were desperate to document them before they were lost to decay. 'The nostalgia around old cars is huge and our viewers loved that seeing some of the classics brought back strong memories from their childhood. That's one of the main reasons why we make our videos. 'I was a massive fan of the Jowett Javelin, however, Andy favoured the Ford Prefect. There are hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cars in that place even if it was for parts on some of them. 'There were around 100 cars across the property,' he added. 'It's hard to know the backstory of all the abandoned places we go. We mostly research as we go but on this occasion, there was very little to find out.' In 2022, an urban explorer discovered a mystery classic car collection just thirty miles from Edinburgh, Scotland - as sixty year old cars were being left to rust. Jaguars and Austins accounted for the majority of vehicles at this location which may be concealing some rare, hidden gems. It's believed that the classic motors were collected by an unknown Jaguar enthusiast. Some of those vehicles dating back to the sixties and were in a sorry state. However, back in the day, the motors were highly sought after. At the time, Jaguars were very fashionable, seen gracing the tracks at the infamous Le Mans race, and cost up to £45,000 in today's currency value.

Up to 100 cars in various condition were discovered cascading down the inside of the cave in Ceredigion, Wales. Urban explorers made a treacherous journey through darkness, in dangerous conditions and were stunned to find a car graveyard at the mine, which closed in 1960. IT Engineer Gregory Rivolet, 31, spent four hours exploring this unlikely last resting place for abandoned vehicles. 'It was very dangerous as the mine is really unstable. Pieces of slate were falling from above our heads,' he said.

Inzwischen gibt es den Zwillingsbruder des VW Tiguan in der zweiten Generation. Sie tritt nicht nur optisch dynamischer auf als der Vorgänger. Die Motorenpalette reicht bis zum 400 PS starken Zweiliter-Turbobenziner im Audi Q3 RS. TOP-ANGEBOT - 20 % Audi Q3: Black Friday Sale statt 38.300,00 EUR 30.652,00 EUR Zum Angebot Der grundsätzlich fünftürige Audi Q3 ist antriebsseitig so etwas wie die ""eierlegende Wollmilchsau"" unter den Kompakt-SUV. Wem 150 PS Diesel-PS und Vorderradantrieb genügen, der wird bei der Ingolstädter Marke ebenso fündig wie der Leistungsfanatiker, der mit den 400 PS des Audi Q3 RS dank Allradantrieb auch auf losem Untergrund oder im Nassen richtig schnell unterwegs sein kann. Clever: Werden die hinteren Sitze nicht gebraucht, lässt sich der Kofferraum durch die um 15 Zentimeter längs verschiebbare Rücksitzbank beträchtlich erweitern. Noch ein Pluspunkt: Das Cockpit bietet eine gelungene Mischung aus sportlich und edel. 245 PS und Allradantrieb gibt's im Black-Friday-Sale! Die Vermittlungsplattform Carwow bietet aktuell den Audi Q3 45 TFSI quattro mit einem Black-Friday-Rabatt in Höhe von 10.651 Euro im Vergleich zum Listenpreis an. Unter dessen Haube arbeitet der aus dem VW Golf GTI bekannte Zweiliter-Turbobenziner mit 245 PS. Ein Siebengang-Doppelkupplungsgetriebe, S tronic genannt, verteilt die Kraft mittels Quattro-Allradantrieb an alle vier Räder. Damit sprintet dieser Audi Q3 in 5,8 Sekunden auf Tempo 100 und läuft 238 km/h Spitze. Auch die Anhängelast von 2100 Kilogramm kann sich sehen lassen. Sportlich und edel Das aktuelle Extra-Ersparnis-Angebot von Carwow bezieht sich auf die Ausstattungsvariante S line. Sie zeichnet sich durch Stoßfänger mit charakteristischen Einlegern sowie das spezielle Design von Lufteinlässen, Seitenschwellern, Spoiler und Leichtmetallfelgen aus. Das Sportfahrwerk sorgt für besonders dynamisches Fahrverhalten. Zur Serienausstattung gehören außerdem unter anderem das volldigitale Cockpit mit 10-Zoll-Display, Lederlenkrad, Dekoreinlagen in Silber sowie eine ganze Palette elektronischer Fahrerassistenzsysteme.

Department for Transport figures show there were 45 public electric car chargers in Wrexham as of July – down from 47 the year before. The Government set a target of installing 300,000 public electric chargers by 2030, meaning around 3,600 chargers must be installed across the UK per month. Of the chargers installed in Wrexham, 13 were rapid chargers. Department for Transport figures show there were 91 public electric car chargers in Flintshire as of July – up from 51 the year before. Of the chargers installed in Flintshire, 46 were rapid chargers. Nationally, 65,000 chargers had been installed as of July – a rise of 47% on the year before. It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target. But the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000. There were 33 public chargers per 100,000 people in Wrexham and 59 public chargers per 100,000 people in Flintshire. Meanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally. RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: ""It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."" TOP STORIES He said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are ""non-existent in many other parts of the country"", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital. ""Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat,"" he added. ""Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."" A DfT spokesperson said: ""We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK. ""And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles.""",Uncategorized,bing,"The article primarily presents statistical data on the number of electric vehicle charge points in specific regions of the UK, namely Flintshire and Wrexham.

Mobile Speicher jeder Größe: So finden Sie die richtige Powerstation,Eine Powerstation ist ein portabler Energiespeicher. Er liefert Strom unter anderem per Steckdose aus. AUTO BILD hat Geräte unterschiedlicher Größe im Test geprüft.,https://www.autobild.de/produkttests/powerstation-test-21979629.html,,2024-11-23 06:30:00,Julia Struck,,"Wer im Camper umherreist, holt sich mit einer Powerstation eine mobile Stromversorgung an Bord. Auch als Notstromversorgung für zu Hause dienen diese tragbaren Speicher. Im Gegensatz zu kleineren Powerbanks bieten Powerstations die Möglichkeit, elektronische Geräte nicht nur via USB, sondern auch über normale 230-Volt-Steckdosen zu betreiben. Ein großer Vorteil ist die Möglichkeit, ihren Akku durch Solarenergie zu laden, weshalb die Geräte oft als ""Solargeneratoren"" bezeichnet werden. Wir haben verschiedene Modelle mit Speicherkapazitäten von bis zu zwei Kilowattstunden getestet. Unsere Bestenliste zeigt die aktuell verfügbaren Modelle. Das Wichtigste in Kürze Powerstations sind zuverlässige Stromquellen fernab von Steckdosen – ideal für den Einsatz beim Camping .

Test-Empfehlung 1,3 sehr gut Anker Solix C1000 1,3 sehr gut Erweiterbarer Speicher Hohe und effiziente Solarladeleistung Viele Anschlüsse Hält Kapazitätsversprechen Etwas laut bei hoher Leistungsabgabe Zum Angebot Die Anker Solix C1000 bringt eine perfekte Mischung mit. Ihre mittlere Kapazität von rund einer Kilowattstunde kommt im kompakten Format und mit leistungsstarken Ladeanschlüssen. Ihr Akku kann per Kabel innerhalb einer Stunde vollständig geladen werden. In unserem Test erreichte die C1000 über ihre beiden Solareingänge eine Ladeleistung von bis zu 621 Watt, wobei sie die Energie effizient verwandelt. Wem die Kapazität nicht genügt, der verdoppelt den 1-kWh-Speicher durch eine Erweiterung. Zusätzliche Funktionen, wie die Steuerung und Programmierung des Ladevorgangs über eine App, machen die Anker Solix C1000 zu einer rundum empfehlenswerten Wahl. Preislich setzt sie sich vor ihre gleich guten Konkurrenten der EcoFlow-Delta-2-Serie und erlangt so den Testsieg. Preis zum Testzeitpunkt: 535 Euro. Test-Empfehlung 1,9 gut Bluetti EB3A 1,9 gut Hohe Leistungsabgabe für die Größe Lädt schnell Taschenlampenfunktion Drahtlos laden möglich Geringe Kapazität fürs Geld Höhere Ladeverluste Zum Angebot Die Powerstation Bluetti EB3A überrascht trotz ihres kompakten Formats mit einer verhältnismäßig kräftigen Leistungsabgabe von 600 Watt, wobei die Ports kurzzeitig sogar bis zu 1,2 Kilowatt erbringen. Die nutzbare Kapazität von 227 Wh ist zwar überschaubar, dafür punktet die EB3A mit schnellen Ladezeiten: In gut 1,5 Stunden lädt sie von 0 auf 100 Prozent. Die begleitende App erhöht den Bedienkomfort. Allerdings liegt der Preis ein wenig über dem, was man aufgrund der kleinen Speicherkapazität erwarten würde. Preis zum Testzeitpunkt: ab 210 Euro. So hat AUTO BILD die Powerstations getestet Wir haben die Solargeneratoren gründlich geprüft. Unsere Experten haben Folgendes bewertet: Akkukapazität: Im hauseigenen Testlabor haben wir untersucht, ob die angegebene Kapazität mit der real verfügbaren Energiemenge übereinstimmt. Eine Glühlampe diente als konstante Last, ein Messgerät zeichnete die Leistung auf. Zudem flossen die Akkutechnologie und das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis in Bezug auf die Laufzeit in unsere Bewertung ein, um auch kompaktere Modelle fair zu beurteilen. Ladevorgang: Wir haben die Powerstations von leer auf voll über die heimische 230-Volt-Steckdose geladen und den Prozess genau überwacht. Für Solarladungen haben wir eine spezialisierte Ladestation eingesetzt, die reale Sonnenverläufe nachbildet, um auch bei weniger optimalen Wetterbedingungen verlässliche Ergebnisse zu garantieren. Anschließend haben wir die Powerstations wieder gleichmäßig entladen, um die nutzbare Leistung zu messen. Neben den maximalen Ladeströmen haben wir auch die Energieverluste beim Laden genau unter die Lupe genommen. Stromversorgung: Die Tester haben die Anschlüsse der Geräte inspiziert und speziell bei der 230-Volt-Steckdose geprüft, ob die Powerstations die Herstellerangaben zur Leistungsabgabe über einen Zeitraum von 15 Minuten einhalten können. Alltagstauglichkeit: Wir haben die Geräte hinsichtlich Größe und Gewicht in Relation zur Leistung bewertet, die Geräuschentwicklung während des Betriebs überprüft, den Lieferumfang gesichtet sowie die Anzeigenqualität und allgemeine Verarbeitung beurteilt. Zoom Im Testlabor der Redaktion wurde die Leistungsfähigkeit genau geprüft. Bild: AUTO BILD In der nachfolgenden Tabelle finden Sie die Testergebnisse der getesteten Geräte.

Diese laden tendenziell langsamer als vergleichbare Modelle mit schlankem Kabel. Besonders langsam geht es bei der Anker 521 mit maximal 73 Watt sowie der Jackery Explorer 240 mit 65 Watt, während die EcoFlow Delta 2 Max mit 2236 Watt rasant lädt und auch der Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus beeindruckende 2006 Watt über die Steckdose lädt. Negativ fiel die Allpowers S1500 auf. Sie verzeichnet hohe Ladeverluste und zieht Strom, selbst wenn der Akku voll ist, wobei das Netzteil heiß wird. Aufladen mit Solarmodul: Wir haben die maximale Energieaufnahme und Dauer der Solarladung getestet. Die Bluetti EB3A sticht unter den kleineren Geräten mit einer Ladezeit von nur knapp 1,5 Stunden bei bis zu 209 Watt hervor, während die Anker 521 über sechs Stunden Sonne bräuchte, und mit maximal 63 Watt lädt.

Anschlüsse im Check Powerstations funktionieren auch ohne Sonnenenergie. Bei der Auswahl eines passenden Solarpanels muss es nicht zwingend vom selben Fabrikat sein, solange die technischen Spezifikationen übereinstimmen und die Anschlüsse kompatibel sind. Sollten sie nicht passen, kann ein Adapter Abhilfe schaffen. In unseren Tests sind uns verschiedene Anschlusstypen häufig begegnet, unter anderem: MC4, der klassische Anschluss für stationäre Solarpanels, Anderson-Konnektoren in Rot-Schwarz, XT60 und DC7909. Weitere Details zu den Verbindungsmöglichkeiten zwischen Solarpanels und Powerstations finden Sie in einem speziellen Ratgeber auf computerbild.de Zoom Umfangreich: Alle Powerstations bieten 230-Volt-Steckdosen. Dazu kommen diverse USB-Anschlüsse für Handy und Co. Bild: AUTO BILD Bei einer Powerstation kommt es darauf an, wie lange sie elektrische Geräte mit Energie versorgt. Tatsächlich halten alle getesteten Modelle ihr Leistungsversprechen. Größere Speicher bieten naturgemäß in der Regel eine höhere Leistung an als kleinere, doch selbst innerhalb gleicher Größenklassen gibt es merkliche Unterschiede. So leistet die kompakte Anker 521 bescheidene 200 Watt, während die gleich große Bluetti EB3A beeindruckende 600 Watt konstant und bis zu 1200 Watt kurzfristig liefert – allerdings zehrt hoher Verbrauch schnell an ihrer Kapazität. Powerstations mit einer Kapazität von 1 kWh garantieren mindestens 1200 Watt Dauerleistung, wobei die Anker Solix C1000 und EcoFlow Delta 2 sogar 1800 Watt dauerhaft bereitstellen. Unter den Schwergewichten sticht die Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus hervor, die stabile 3000 Watt liefert.

Er kann viel Schnee, Sturm und Minusgrade, aber auch verhältnismäßig milde Temperaturen bereithalten. Einige Autobesitzende dürften sich daher die Frage stellen, ob das Aufziehen von Winterreifen denn überhaupt zwingend notwendig ist. Dann sollten sie aber auch wissen, wann Bußgelder für eine falsche Bereifung drohen. In Deutschland gilt die sogenannte situative Winterreifenpflicht – Wann ein Bußgeld droht © Kirchner-Media/ Imago Wann Sommerreifen im Winter erlaubt sind Im Winter bieten Sommerreifen eine schlechtere Haftung und längere Bremswege, was das Unfallrisiko erhöhen kann. Eine gesetzlich verankerte Reifenwechsel-Regel gibt es allerdings nicht. Viele Autofahrende orientieren sich daher oftmals an der „O-bis-O-Regel“, fahren also von Oktober bis Ostern mit Winterreifen. Die Straßenverkehrsordnung(§ 2 Abs. 3 StVO) gibt lediglich vor, dass Winterreifen bei winterlichen Wetterverhältnissen wie etwa Schnee, Glatteis, Frost oder Eis Pflicht sind. Es gibt aber Ausnahmen: Wer sein Fahrzeug im Winter sowieso beabsichtigt stehen zu lassen, kann auf die gesonderte Bereifung verzichten und muss keine Strafe für Sommerreifen im Winter erwarten, erklärt das Ratgeber-Portal bussgeldkatalog.org. Selbst im tiefsten Schneesturm sei es demnach erlaubt, mit Sommerreifen zu parken. Ein Satz guter Reifen ist nicht billig, daher sollten bei der Einlagerung einige Dinge beachtet werden. Auch beim Transport ist Vorsicht geboten.

Dazu gehöre es, vor der Abfahrt zu prüfen, ob es erforderlich sei, die geplante Fahrt durchzuführen, da das Ziel mit alternativen Verkehrsmitteln nicht erreichbar ist. Außerdem dürfe nicht schneller als 50 km/h gefahren werden.

Denn „wer bei winterlichen Straßenverhältnissen einen Unfall mit Sommerreifen verursacht, dem können wegen grober Fahrlässigkeit Leistungen in der Kaskoversicherung gekürzt werden“ erklärt der ADAC.

Jannick Ripking © Ripking, Jannick Der Diepholzer Hans-Heinrich Kellner sorgt sich um die Verkehrssicherheit in der Kreisstadt. Im Fokus: Radfahrer, die „die ihre Vorfahrt an Zebrastreifen erzwingen“. Diepholz – Hans-Heinrich Kellner ist enttäuscht und ein bisschen wütend. Der Diepholzer beklagt, dass sich zu viele Fahrrad- und E-Scooter-Fahrer in seiner Heimatstadt in Niedersachsen nicht an die Straßenverkehrsordnung halten. Er beobachte, zunehmende Missachtungen und daraus resultierende Verkehrsgefährdungen. Besonders hat er dabei die Zebrastreifen im Blick: „Viele Radfahrer erzwingen dort ihre Vorfahrt. Sie fahren einfach nach dem Motto: Der Autofahrer wird schon anhalten.“ Dabei haben am Zebrastreifen nur diejenigen Vorrang, die entweder gehen oder ihr Gefährt schieben – es sei denn, Verkehrszeichen schreiben etwas anderes vor. Zebrastreifen im Fokus: „Viele Radfahrer erzwingen ihre Vorfahrt“ „Es ist ja nicht so, dass mich das nur ärgert, es ist auch gefährlich“, sagt Hans-Heinrich Kellner. „Viele Radfahrer fahren einfach und gucken nicht nach links und rechts“, berichtet er und fragt: „Mit welchem Recht? Ich denke, einige wissen es nicht besser. Kommt die Verkehrserziehung zu kurz?“ Kellner kritisiert, dass das Bewusstsein, dass Zebrastreifen nur dann Vorrang gewähren, wenn Radfahrer absteigen und schieben, in der Öffentlichkeit zu wenig Raum findet. Er betont, dass er nicht den gesamten Fahrradverkehr in Diepholz an den Pranger stellen will: Es gebe Radfahrer, die sich an die Straßenverkehrsordnung halten. Ebenso gebe es Autofahrer, die es in Sachen Verkehrssicherheit nicht so genau nehmen. Doch die Masse an Fehlverhalten des Zweiradverkehrs bereite ihm Sorgen. Er wünscht sich daher mehr Aufklärungsarbeit seitens der Polizei. „Man kann sich eine Stunde an einen Zebrastreifen stellen und die Fahrradfahrer, die sich nicht richtig verhalten, belehren“, schlägt Kellner vor. Er habe die Behörde diesbezüglich bereits kontaktiert. Bisher habe er nur eine nicht zufriedenstellende Antwort erhalten. „Ich will die Polizei nicht in Misskredit bringen“, aber er wünscht sich, dass seine Hinweise ernst genommen werden. Polizeisprecher Thomas Gissing bedauert, dass Hans-Heinrich Kellner mit der Antwort der Behörde nicht zufrieden ist, versichert auf Nachfrage der Mediengruppe Kreiszeitung aber, dass die Polizei offen für Gespräche ist. Gissing bietet Kellner ein persönliches Gespräch mit Beamten an, „um seine Ideen und deren Umsetzbarkeit zu erörtern“. Kreisel am Hallenbad: Diepholzer beklagt heikle Verkehrssituationen Als besonders heikel bewertet Kellner die Verkehrssituation am Diepholzer Flöthekreisel. Dort kreuzen sowohl ein Radweg als auch ein Fußweg die Ein- und Ausfahrten. Zusätzliche Verkehrszeichen ergänzen die an Kreiseln gängigen Schilder: „Achtung! Fahrräder kreuzen!“, heißt es für Autos. Radfahrer weist ein anderes Schild an, „Blickkontakt“ zu Autofahrern aufzunehmen. „Das wirkt doch wie ein Freifahrtschein für alle Fahrradfahrer“, meint Kellner. Stephanie Paul, Mitarbeiterin der Stadt Diepholz im Bürgermeisterbüro, klärt auf: Da jede Kreiseleinfahrt mit dem Verkehrszeichen „Vorfahrt gewähren“ versehen ist und am Flöthekreisel zusätzlich ein eigenständiger Radweg vorhanden ist, sorgt diese Kombination dafür, dass Autos bei der Einfahrt in den Kreisel nicht nur Fußgängern auf dem Zebrastreifen, sondern „auch den Fahrrädern Vorrang gewähren müssen“, erklärt Paul. Das gilt auch für Autos, die den Kreisverkehr verlassen. Wenn Radfahrer weiter auf dem Radweg fahren, haben sie Vorrang. Währenddessen seien die zusätzlichen Schilder optional und ohne rechtliche Bewandtnis. Paul: „Das Ordnungsamt hat sie in Zusammenarbeit mit der Polizei erarbeitet, weil sich dort in der Vergangenheit vermehrt Unfälle ereignet haben. Sie sollen der zusätzlichen Sicherheit dienen.“ So viel zur Theorie. Kellner ist jedoch der Auffassung, dass die Regelung so speziell ist, dass kaum ein Autofahrer, Radfahrer oder Fußgänger weiß, wie sie in der Praxis umzusetzen ist. Statt die Gefahr zu senken, erhöhe sie sich wegen der Undurchsichtigkeit nur noch mehr. „Was hat man sich dabei gedacht?“, fragt er sich. Radfahrer ohne Licht und E-Scooter mit Doppelbesetzung Kellner führt weitere Gefahrenschwerpunkte an: „Viele Radfahrer sind ohne Licht unterwegs.“ In der dunklen Jahreszeit sorge dieser Umstand für potenziell lebensgefährliche Situationen. Und bei den E-Scootern beobachte Kellner in Diepholz den Trend, „dass sie hier oft in Doppel- oder sogar Dreifachbesetzung unterwegs sind.“ Dabei ist es gesetzlich verboten, diese Fahrzeuge mit mehr als einer Person zu nutzen. Polizeisprecher Thomas Gissing sagt: „Lichter werden von uns in der dunklen Jahreszeit verstärkt kontrolliert.“ Zudem weise die Polizei während ihrer Präventionsarbeit an den Grundschulen „immer wieder darauf hin“, wie wichtig, korrektes Licht am Fahrrad ist. „Doch die erwachsenen Vorbilder, die Eltern, sind in der Pflicht, darauf zu achten, dass es auch umgesetzt wird.“ Gissing fasst zusammen: „Wir tun im Rahmen unserer Möglichkeiten viel, aber wir können nicht überall sein.“ Dessen ist sich Hans-Heinrich Kellner bewusst. Er ist daher der Meinung, dass ein Kontaktbeamter in Diepholz fehlt. Seit einigen Monaten ist dieser nicht mehr da. „Warum gibt es ihn nicht mehr?“, fragt er. Diepholz hat keinen Kontaktbeamten mehr Der frühere Diepholzer Kontaktbeamte Frank Kempin habe Präsenz gezeigt und Aufklärungsarbeit im Straßenverkehr geleistet. Der Polizeisprecher erklärt, dass Kempin „aufgrund dienstlicher Veränderungen“ nicht mehr in der Kreisstadt tätig ist. Die Kontaktbeamtenstelle sei derzeit unbesetzt: „Jede Polizeiinspektion hat ein Personalkontingent. Die momentane Situation lässt eine Neubesetzung nicht zu. Das heißt aber nicht, dass es für immer so ist. Wenn die Möglichkeit besteht, wollen wir diese Stelle gerne wieder besetzen.“",,rss,"The article focuses on traffic safety issues related to cyclists and E-scooter drivers in Diepholz, Germany, rather than on electric vehicles specifically.

Hat der neue BMW M5 viel mehr Power als angegeben?,In den USA hat ein serienmäßiger BMW M5 G90 auf dem Prüfstand deutlich über 800 PS erzielt.

In Social Media brach ein regelrechter Shitstorm über den G90 herein. Der Grund: Der neue BMW M5 wiegt 2435 Kilo und ist somit über eine halbe Tonne schwerer als sein Vorgänger! Die Ursache für die extreme Gewichtszunahme ist der neue Antrieb, denn erstmals hat BMW den M5 mit einem Hybridantrieb ausgestattet. Durch immer strengere Emissionsvorschriften hat der 4,4-Liter große V8-Biturbo im Vergleich zum Vorgänger F90 an Leistung eingebüßt: Statt zuletzt 625 PS im M5 Competition (M5 CS mit 635 PS) liefert der Achtzylinder jetzt ""nur"" noch 585 PS. Da weniger Power bei den leistungsverwöhnten M-Fans sicherlich auch nicht für Jubel gesorgt hätte, entschied sich die M GmbH dazu, dem V8 mit einem in die Achtgangautomatik integrierten Elektromotor unter die Arme zu greifen. Der liefert zusätzliche 197 PS und 280 Nm, wiegt in Kombination mit der 18,6-kWh-Batterie allerdings auch über 400 Kilo. Werksangabe für den BMW M5: 727 PS Trotz 727 PS Systemleistung und 1000 Nm Drehmoment kann der neue M5 dem Vorgänger in puncto Beschleunigung nicht ganz das Wasser reichen. 3,5 Sekunden von 0 auf 100 km/h und 10,9 Sekunden für den Sprint von 0 auf 200 km/h sind per se phänomenale Werte, die der Vorgänger M5 Competition mit weniger Leistung allerdings um jeweils eine Zehntelsekunde unterbietet. Doch es besteht Hoffnung! Nach der berechtigten, aber mittlerweile auch nervigen Gewichtsdiskussion gibt es jetzt positive Nachrichten zum M5 G90. In den USA hat der Tuner ""IND Distribution"" einen nagelneuen M5 auf einem Prüfstand gemessen – mit einem beeindruckenden Ergebnis!

Das ist im Haus günstiger als eine Gasheizung; und bei Elektroautos entlastet es den Akku. Denn E-Autos beziehen technisch bedingt keine Abwärme vom Verbrennungsmotor, die sich via Wärmetauscher zum Aufwärmen des Innenraums nutzen ließe. Wie spart die Wärmepumpe Energie? Ohne Wärmepumpe muss die konventionelle Heizung vereinfacht gesagt über Heizwiderstände verhältnismäßig viel Strom direkt aus dem Fahrakku ziehen. Der fehlt dann fürs Fahren – insbesondere im Winter, wenn Kälte den Akku schwächt. Im Winter saugen zusätzliche Verbraucher wie Heckscheiben-, Lenkrad- und Sitzheizung, Ventilator sowie Fahrlicht Energie. Die Wärmepumpe holt sich zwar ebenfalls Strom aus dem Fahrakku, aber sie benötigt deutlich weniger als eine elektrische Heizung. Zoom Um ein eiskaltes E-Auto aufzuwärmen, benötigt die Wärmepumpe fast so viel Energie wie konventionelle Heizungen. Besser: Vorwärmen an der Ladesäule. Bild: DPA Wie funktioniert die Wärmepumpe im Elektroauto? Die Funktionsweise einer Wärmepumpe ähnelt der eines Kühlschranks. Mit dem Unterschied, dass das Innere vom Kühlschrank gekühlt, der Innenraum des Elektroautos dagegen erwärmt wird. Allerdings funktioniert eine Wärmepumpe auch umgekehrt: Sie kann bei Sommerhitze das Wageninnere kühlen. Akkuheizung . Umgekehrt kühlt sie im Fahrbetrieb eine erhitzte Batterie und nutzt deren Abwärme ebenfalls für die Beheizung des Innenraums. Generell wird der Außenluft die Wärme (oder eben Kälte) über einen Wärmetauscher entzogen. Er gibt die Temperatur an ein Kältemittel weiter, das in einem Kreislauf kursiert. Ein weiterer Wärmetauscher gibt dann die Kälte bzw. Wärme an die Luft ab, die ein Gebläse in den Innenraum transportiert. So versorgt die Wärmepumpe auch die. Umgekehrt kühlt sie im Fahrbetrieb eine erhitzte Batterie und nutzt deren Abwärme ebenfalls für die Beheizung des Innenraums. Wie viel Akku-Reichweite spart die Wärmepumpe? ""Als Faustformel lässt sich sagen, dass für eine Heizleistung von 2,5 bis 3 Kilowatt eine Pumpenleistung von 1 Kilowatt notwendig ist – das gilt für Luftwärmepumpen in Häusern"", sagt Matthias Vogt vom ADAC. Bleibt also bei der Wärmepumpe eine Ersparnis von ungefähr 1,5 bis 2 kW, die nicht aus dem Akku gezogen werden – und damit für mehr Reichweite zur Verfügung stehen. Geht man davon aus, dass moderne Elektroautos im Alltagsbetrieb um die 20 kWh Strom auf 100 km verbrauchen, kommt man auf eine Ersparnis von rund zehn Prozent. Bei einer Akku-Reichweite von 300 km ergäbe sich ein Reichweiten-Plus von ungefähr 30 km. Rein rechnerisch natürlich, denn in der Praxis erschweren viele Unbekannte die Berechnung. Kia zum Beispiel gibt beim EV6 den Reichweiten-Zugewinn mit etwa 50 km an. Wann arbeitet die Wärmepumpe am effizientesten? Matthias Vogt: ""Es gibt so viele Faktoren, die die Effizienz beeinflussen, dass der Nutzen der Wärmepumpe allein schwierig zu beurteilen ist."" So habe jedes Elektroauto-Modell einen anderen Effizienzgrad. Und je nach Außentemperatur arbeite die Wärmepumpe mal mehr, mal weniger effizient. ""Je niedriger die Temperatur, desto schwieriger für die Wärmepumpe"", sagt Matthias Vogt. Er fügt hinzu: ""Bei wirklichen Minusgraden ist kein signifikanter Vorteil der Wärmepumpe feststellbar."" Dann wird ihre Ausbeute einfach zu gering. Zoom Stefan Moeller von Nextmove testete einen Kia e-Niro mit Wärmepumpe: Er übernachtete bei Minusgraden im Auto, um die Akku-Kapazität zu testen. Bild: nextmove.de Ein weiterer Aspekt, den Käufer von Elektroautos kennen sollten: ""In der Aufheizphase kann die Wärmepumpe ihre Stärken noch nicht ausspielen, da hier immer eine hohe Heizleistung erforderlich ist"", sagt Stefan Moeller von Nextmove, Deutschlands größtem Elektroauto-Vermieter. Mit anderen Worten: Nach einer eisigen Winternacht braucht die Wärmepumpe zum Aufwärmen des Innenraums fast genauso viel Strom wie die elektrische Heizung. Moeller testete im Winter die Heizleistung eines Kia e-Niro mit Wärmepumpe, indem er bei Minusgraden darin übernachtete Was ist auf der Kurzstrecke besser als die Wärmepumpe? Moeller: ""Wir beobachten beim Kaltstart je nach Modell Heizleistungen von 4 bis 9 kW. Im Kurzstreckenbetrieb bringt eine Wärmepumpe also nicht viel."" Nach seiner Erfahrung sind für die Kurzstrecke Lenkrad- und Sitzheizung mindestens ebenso gut geeignet – aber viel günstiger in der Anschaffung. Bei VW ID.3 und Kia EV6 zum Beispiel ist beides bereits im Basismodell Serie. Der Trick: Hier wird die Wärme ""direkt am Körper platziert"", so Moeller. Der Energiebedarf liegt bei unter 100 Watt. Einen weiteren Schritt geht der beheizbare Sicherheitsgurt, den der Zulieferer ZF kürzlich vorstellte. Er ist bis auf 40 Grad aufheizbar und soll bis zu 15 Prozent Energieeinsparung bringen. Vor 2025 ist allerdings nicht mit einer Markteinführung zu rechnen. Bei Fahrtests hat Nextmove mit der Wärmepumpe vor allem auf der Langstrecke akzeptable Resultate gemessen: ""Bei einigen Modellen konnte sie den Verbrauch für die Beheizung auf längeren Fahrten mehr als halbieren"", so Stefan Moeller gegenüber AUTO BILD. Nach seiner Einschätzung liegt die Einsparung insgesamt bei fünf bis zehn Prozent. Für wen lohnt sich die Wärmepumpe, für wen eher nicht? Rechnet man die knapp 1000 Euro Aufpreis in Stromersparnis um, bedeutet es (erneut sehr grob geschätzt): Bei zehn Prozent Stromersparnis wäre die Anschaffung nach etwa 100.000 Kilometern amortisiert, es sei denn, die Wärmepumpe steckt serienmäßig im Auto drin, dann fällt die Berechnung schwer. Diese Kalkulation betrifft nur die reine Investition. Hinzu kommen natürlich der Komfort- und Zeitgewinn. Denn man braucht im Winter weniger Ladestopps und kann weiter fahren. Was sagt der Experte dazu? ""Es kommt darauf an"", ist das diplomatische Fazit von Moeller. Wer in gemäßigten Breiten mit milden Wintern lebt, eine temperierte Garage nutzen kann und nur Kurzstrecke fährt, benötigt demnach keine Wärmepumpe. Für regelmäßigen Langstreckenbetrieb, eiskalte Nächte und Laternenparker dagegen ist sie in jedem Fall attraktiv. Und natürlich für alle, die an einer etwas höheren Reichweite interessiert sind – auch wenn es am Ende nur 15 bis 20 Kilometer sind. Nicht zu vergessen: der höhere Wiederverkaufswert, wenn man das E-Auto als Gebrauchtwagen weiterverkauft. Wie bemerkt man die Arbeit der Wärmepumpe beim Vorheizen? Ein weiterer Unterschied ist hörbar: ""Den Betrieb kann der Kunde durchaus wahrnehmen"", sagt Matthias Vogt vom ADAC. So würde sich eine aktivierte Wärmepumpe beim Vorheizen im Stand durch vernehmliches Brummen und Vibration bemerkbar machen. Man hört die Anlage also arbeiten. Der Geräuschpegel der Auto-Wärmepumpe könne durchaus auf dem Level der stationären Gebäude-Wärmepumpe liegen, so Vogt. Zoom Im Winter haben Akkus weniger Kapazität, außerdem ziehen Verbraucher wie Heckscheibenheizung und Licht mehr Energie. Bild: Toni Bader Auch während der Fahrt bemerke zumindest der Fahrer es, wenn sich die Wärmepumpe einschaltet: Das ist zum Beispiel durch Vibration am Lenkrad erkennbar. Die Geräuschentwicklung ist aber nicht immer gleich. Vogt: ""Das hängt wohl damit zusammen, wie stark die Pumpe arbeiten muss und wie gut die Anlage von der Karosserie entkoppelt ist."" Auf die Fahrdynamik hat der Betrieb der Wärmepumpe keinen Einfluss. Lässt sich die Wärmepumpe im Elektroauto nachrüsten? Bei vielen älteren Elektroautos ist keine Wärmepumpe installiert. Leider lässt sich dieses Bauteil meist nicht nachträglich einbauen, da die Flüssigkeitskreisläufe anders ausgelegt sind. Gebrauchte E-Autos lassen sich also nicht im Nachhinein mit Wärmepumpe (WP) ausstatten. ""Das Heizungssystem unterscheidet sich deutlich von der Variante ohne WP"", so Matthias Vogt vom ADAC.

Schön: Es gibt im Q4 – anders als bei vielen anderen MEB-Autos – ein ordentliches Kombiinstrument (10,25 Zoll). Der Touchscreen ist hier 11,6 Zoll groß, liegt näher beim Fahrer und lässt sich besser erreichen. Die Menü-Struktur ist logisch, die Grafik zurückhaltend. Zoom Das Cockpit im Audi wirkt etwas verschachtelt. Vorteil: Der Touchscreen liegt näher beim Fahrer, ist gut zu erreichen. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Und es gibt eine Extra-Bedienleiste fürs Klima. Die Spracheingabe beherrscht weniger Fahrzeugfunktionen als die im BMW, reagiert manchmal schleppend, liefert aber gern und ohne Verzögerung viele Infos von Wikipedia. Beim Sprint liegt der BMW vorne Q4 und iX1 werden von je einem E-Motor vorn und hinten angetrieben, die Systemleistung liegt beim Audi bei 286 PS, beim BMW sind es 313 PS. Der iX1 hat bei den Fahrleistungen die Nase vorn, den Sprint von 0 auf 100 km/h erledigt er rasant in 5,4 Sekunden, läuft maximal 180 km/h. Die schafft auch der Audi, für den Standard-Sprint brauchte er 6,6 Sekunden, immer noch ziemlich schnell. Feine Rekuperation im Q4 Das E-System im Q4 lässt sich fein dosieren, die Rekuperation ist in drei Stufen mit den Paddles am Lenkrad verstellbar, dazu gibt es die Wahl zwischen Stufe B und D beim Getriebe, nicht jedoch eine One-Pedal-Funktion bis zum Stillstand. Zoom Zusatzenergie: Die Rekuperation im Audi lässt sich fein dosieren, bis zum vollständigen Stillstand bringt sie den Q4 aber nicht. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Über die verfügt der BMW – in der Getriebestellung B. Hier ist auch die Bremswirkung erheblich stärker als im Q4. Im iX1 reagiert das E-System noch einen Funken schneller und sensibler als im Q4, temperamentvoller. Die Rekuperation lässt sich in vier Stufen verstellen – allerdings nur im Menü. Im iX1-Fahrwerk steckt mehr Lebendigkeit Der iX1 xDrive30 besitzt serienmäßig das Adaptive M Fahrwerk – das arbeitet mit variablen, mechanisch geregelten Stoßdämpfern (mit Zusatzventilen), verbunden mit der Sportlenkung und einer Tieferlegung um 1,5 Zentimeter. So liegt der BMW strammer auf der Straße, federt straffer als der Audi. Zoom Dynamiker: Dank adaptivem M Fahrwerk (Serie) und 1,5 Zentimetern Tieferlegung liegt der iX1 strammer auf der Straße als der Q4. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Die Lenkung spricht für unseren Geschmack aus der Mitte zu leicht an, arbeitet ansonsten aber mit verbindlicher Rückmeldung. Im direkten Vergleich fährt sich der 200 Kilogramm (!) leichtere iX1 eine Spur lebendiger und handlicher als der Audi. Bremsen bei beidem auf hohem Niveau Der Test-Q4 war ausgestattet mit dem Dynamikpaket plus (1130 Euro) mit adaptiven Dämpfern und Progressivlenkung. Die Lenkung hat uns gut gefallen, präzise und direkt, vielleicht nur einen Hauch zu entkoppelt, passt jedenfalls sehr schön zum Auto. Audi hat den Q4 angenehm komfortabel ausgelegt, er rollt sanfter ab als der BMW, nimmt vor allem kleine Anregungen sehr souverän, auch mit den 20-Zoll-Rädern des Testwagens (BMW 19 Zoll). Zoom Ausgezeichnete Stopper: Trotz ihrer hohen Gewichte überzeugen BMW iX1 und Audi Q4 e-tron mit kurzen Bremswegen Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Der Audi kommt MEB-typisch mit Trommelbremsen hinten. Macht aber nichts, für den Stopp aus Tempo 100 km/h mit warmen Bremsen brauchte er 34,8 Meter, der BMW stand nach 34,6 Metern – sehr gut, alle beide!

Hier spricht sie über Camping als Quelle für Comedy, skurrile Platznachbarn und zeigt uns exklusiv ihr Urlaubsmobil.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/komikerin-mirja-boes-im-gespraech-27667013.html,,2024-11-23 05:00:00,René Weihrauch,,"AUTO BILD REISEMOBIL: Frau Boes, bitte Ihr Urteil als Comedy-Profi und Reisemobilistin: Wie lustig sind Camper? Mirja Boes: Nicht lustiger als andere Menschen, aber der Mensch an sich ist ja schon lustig – und beim Campen ist man hautnah dran, deshalb kann man sehr schöne Beobachtungen machen. Wer hat da diese riesige Satellitenschüssel auf dem Dach? Was ist das für ein Typ mit dem Kühlschrank vor dem Wohnmobil? Manche kommen mit einem Gefährt, das fast so groß ist wie ein Einfamilienhaus, und unten rollt noch ein kleines Auto raus. Da denke ich mir: Dann kann ich auch gleich eine Ferienwohnung mieten. Einmal hatten wir einen Platznachbarn, der hatte seinen Vogel mitgenommen. Der Käfig hing tagsüber immer vor dem Reisemobil, und das Tier hat von morgens bis abends laut gezwitschert. Das war schon skurril. Also: Ein Campingplatz ist auf jeden Fall ein guter Nährboden für Comedy. Gibt’s auch Camper, die nerven? Lustigerweise – obwohl es so eine individuelle und freie Art ist, Urlaub zu machen –, lustigerweise gibt es immer noch einige, die alles ganz, ganz genau nehmen. Da muss jeder Wimpel exakt an seinem Platz hängen, die stehen immer an derselben Stelle, und niemand darf ihnen in die Quere kommen: ""Ich stehe immer hier!"" Ich glaube aber, die meisten Camper sind heute nicht mehr die, die den Gartenzwerg vorm Wohnmobil haben, sondern alles in allem ist das eine ziemlich coole Gruppe. Und total hilfsbereit. Zoom Diesen Pilote P696 Evidence mieten Mirja und ihre Familie seit Jahren für den Sommerurlaub. Erlebnisse mit der Bordtoilette hat sie sogar in ihr neues Programm eingebaut. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Wir hatten uns mal in einem Matschloch festgefahren, da hat uns ein Dauercamper aus dem Ruhrgebiet herausgezogen. Der hatte so einen Jeep mit Kurbel und offenbar seit Wochen drauf gewartet, dass er sie endlich mal einsetzen konnte. Bis wir kamen. Der hatte einen Riesenspaß. … und dann war das auch noch jemand, den er aus dem TV kannte! Genau. Beim nächsten Mal hat er wahrscheinlich seinen Kumpels erzählt: Die Alte da im Fernsehen, die hatte sich festgefahren, und ich hab sie rausgezerrt. Aber im Ernst: Das war ein super Typ und eine spektakuläre Aktion. Wie sind Sie zum Camping gekommen? Viele haben ja schon in der Kindheit die Ferien auf dem Zeltplatz verbracht. Ich überhaupt nicht. Meine Eltern waren eher so die Ferienwohnung-Urlauber. Ich bin durch erst durch meinen Freund dazu gekommen. Der hatte einen T4, mit dem wir insgesamt 14 Jahre im Urlaub unterwegs waren, sogar noch als unsere beiden Söhne da waren. Die Kinder haben im Bulli übernachtet und wir im Zelt davor. Zoom AUTO BILD REISEMOBIL traf den Comedystar an den Kölner Jahnwiesen neben dem Müngersdorfer Stadion. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Klingt romantisch, aber nicht gerade nach Glamping. Richtig. Irgendwann haben mein älterer Sohn und ich dann auch gesagt: Es reicht mit dem Bulli, ab jetzt nur noch mit Toilette und fließend Wasser. Seitdem mieten wir jedes Jahr den teilintegrierten Pilote von einem Freund, der in Paderborn eine Wohnmobilvermietung betreibt. Glamping würde ich das aber immer noch nicht nennen. Wir haben es im Urlaub lieber einfach, das fängt schon beim Essen an. Wir grillen oft oder machen Nudeln mit Ketchup. Ich finde: Camping ist schon auch Verzicht. Du schränkst dich in vielen Sachen ein, aber das ist ja gerade das Schöne. Haben Sie ein festes Reiseziel, oder fahren Sie einfach der Nase nach? Wir fahren immer nach Südfrankreich, unser Stammplatz liegt auf dem Cap Ferrat. Da treffen wir auch jedes Jahr Freunde. Insgesamt sind wir so drei Wochen unterwegs. Der Vorteil dieser Art zu reisen ist aus meiner Sicht: Der Urlaub fängt sofort an. Wir reisen in aller Ruhe an, machen unterwegs zwei-, dreimal Station, letztes Jahr zum Beispiel auf dem Parkplatz vom Disneyland in Paris , weil die Kinder da unbedingt mal hinwollten. Nach der Ankunft gibt es dann immer einen Großeinkauf in einem dieser riesigen französischen Supermärkte. Das ist schon ein Ritual. Zoom Voll normal: Für die Kölnerin gehört ein Kölsch selbstredend zum Reiseproviant. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Wer fährt? Wir wechseln uns ab. Mir macht das viel Spaß. Ich fahre auch gern mal unseren Band-Bus, wenn wir zu Auftritten fahren. Nur das Einparken überlasse ich meinem Freund. Mein Job ist das Einwinken. Ihre Söhne sind jetzt elf und 13. Wird es nicht langsam ein bisschen eng, zu viert drei Wochen lang im Reisemobil? Nein, das funktioniert noch gut. Man muss sich halt arrangieren … Inwiefern? Na ja, unsere Jungs haben zum Beispiel unterschiedliche Hygienevorstellungen. Der ältere pickt jeden Krümel mit der Pinzette von der Matratze, und sein Bruder würde sich am liebsten vom Strand direkt ins Bett legen. Deshalb schlafen die beiden in den getrennten Betten im Heck und mein Freund und ich im Hubbett. Nicht ganz so bequem, aber andersherum würde es ein Handgemenge geben. Und das will man ja nicht. Mal ganz grundsätzlich: Was braucht es für einen gelungenen Reisemobilurlaub? So simpel es sich anhört, aber es kommt doch sehr aufs Wetter an. Wenn das gut ist – alles super. Wobei es auch gemütlich sein kann, wenn nachts der Regen aufs Dach prasselt. Wir hatten aber mal einen Urlaub, der ist total schiefgegangen, weil es 14 Tage lang nur geregnet hat. Das war noch mit dem T4 in der Bretagne. Was es nicht leichter machte: Mein erster Sohn war damals noch klein und wollte partout nicht, dass seine Schuhe von unten nass werden. Camping kann einen manchmal auch ganz schön fordern. Zoom Damit die Jungs mehr Platz haben, macht Mirja das Bett im Heck für ihre Söhne fertig. Sie und ihr Freund nehmen das Hubbett. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Wild zu campen ist für Sie also eher keine Option? Das ist tatsächlich das Einzige, wo ich ein bisschen spießig bin. Ich brauche in der Nähe einen Stromanschluss. Ich habe immer Panik, dass irgendetwas nicht funktioniert. Ich bin auch diejenige, die ständig kontrolliert, ob noch genug Wasser da ist. Okay, zwei, drei Tage ist man je nach Fahrzeugmodell ja mehr oder weniger autark. Da ist Wildcampen eine Möglichkeit. Aber irgendwie bin ich dann doch froh, wenn man wieder Anschluss an die Zivilisation hat. Zur Person Mirja Boes Mirja Boes (Jahrgang 1971) wurde in Viersen am Niederrhein geboren.

Indeed, as our own Conor Knell discovered during a test drive, the abrupt plunge from 70 to a 50 mph restriction is a reliable giveaway of who’s local and who’s not. Newcomers, he found, slam on their brakes in anticipation of imminent speed cameras while regulars steam on by, treating the legal limits as mere guidelines. It seems worlds away from Coventry's rigorous streets where a host of average speed cameras rigorously enforce motoring discipline. Coventry motorists opened up about their experiences, with Conan the Mermaid reflecting: ""All the cars that I have driven in my 70+ years show the speed to be approximately 10% greater than the actual. This means when you think you are doing 50, you're doing only 45. Thus the glares from the impatient others. Hope this helps."" READ MORE: Tribute to 'devoted' dad in Coventry's death and funeral notices this week PERCY adds: ""Yep driven down there and all cars pass me. We need average speed cameras on as many roads as possible. The difference is noticeable straight away, .and all you who hate them, carry on speeding, pay your fine then we'll get more cameras, win win."" Mxlerone writes: ""What's weird is that when they were building the new tollbar roundabout and flyover, that 50mph section had average speed cameras put in place and everything worked fine (or you received a fine). For some reason it must have been decided to allow the road to descend into anarchy through their removal instead."" Kenpas says: ""The reason the speed limit is 50mph on that part of the A46/A45, is the bend under the Toll Bar junction, as speeding vehicles are in danger of overturning under the junction. Also there is parking places built along that stretch for the mobile speed cameras to park up. I haven't seen any mobile cameras on it yet!!"" Disorganised1 adds: ""Just drive around the ring road. I get overtaken daily driving at the speed limit, and on both sides of the car - often by private hire cars."" Mikehf comments: ""Never have any problem sticking to the speed limit."" Destroyedcountry believes: ""Oh dear, anyone with a inch of common sense would never have set the speed limits as they are!"" Over on our Facebook page - Belle Barnes says: ""Excellent point and I don’t know why it’s not been called out before. I regularly drive on that road and I too follow the speed limit signs. They are there for a reason so when you feel like your the one in the wrong, the truth is that everyone else driving at 60/70 mph are in the wrong. I agree, it’s an accident waiting to happen. Maybe this article will make the highways agency or whoever deals with our roads, sort it out once and for all."" While Saucey Sue adds: ""The 50mph stretch is round by the jaguar and A444/Warwick bypass where there are multiple lanes for different places, similar to the picture of the article above, as well as slip roads joining. It’s by far safer to reduce the speed limit than having everyone trying to achieve national speed limit whilst also trying to be in the correct lane. I guarantee there’d be people screaming about the number of accidents if the speed limit was 70. And remember people, a speed limit is not a target, it’s a maximum speed allowed."" Vicki Walls-Gilbert thinks: ""Well if you’re driving to the letter of the law you’ll be in the left hand lane and not be holding up anyone who wishes to speed as you’ll pull over as soon as you’ve over taken. Which leaves a lane free for the speedsters! You will also not travel in the right hand lane for miles, not over taking anything, often travelling way below the speed limit simply because you haven’t got the balls to change into the right hand lane as you approach your junction to turn right.""

Automakers anxious over electric vehicle demand amid Trump's return to presidency,"A recent New York Times headline claimed automakers want the incoming Trump Administration to ""require"" them to sell electric vehicles.

In a story published in the New York Times on Thursday, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are asking president-elect Donald Trump to ""please require us to sell electric vehicles."" Auto analysts like John McElroy were not impressed. Advertisement Advertisement ""The headline is totally misleading. The automakers are not begging the Trump administration to force them to sell EVs. That's not the case at all,"" he told FOX 2. The story about domestic automakers pleading with Trump goes beyond just selling cars. In what became one of the biggest political hot potatoes of the 2024 presidential election, the regime change in the executive branch means all the money that the Biden administration has poured into subsidies could be reversed. Following calls to roll back federal electric vehicle regulations on the campaign trail, there is now anxiety over what Trump will do - and how automakers should respond. ""What the automakers want is for the Trump administration to keep the subsidies on for EVs so they can sell these things,"" said McElroy. Advertisement Advertisement Even with regulations encouraging consumers to buy EVs, the demand has not been there. But there is a good degree of labor and jobs wrapped up in the industry - and changes to regulations mean some could lose their jobs. ""If he does something like this and you start seeing really a lot of layoffs with this, then it’s really going to hurt him politically, and I think it will overall hurt the Republicans politically,"" said Dr. Jeff Rightmer, of Wayne State University. The reason behind the industry's pivot and current administration's push to sell more is to fight climate change, thanks to the emissions that gas-powered cars produce. Advertisement Advertisement ""The EPA set these very stringent standards to fight global warming, but to get there you need to sell electric cars. Electric cars are not affordable and so the government's providing subsidies to help this all happens,"" said McElroy. But without enough buyers, examples like Ford losing $3.7 billion this year in its electric division due to idling its F-150 Lightning plant are cropping up in the news. And lacking enough governmental support, domestic automakers could fall further behind. ""They’ve invested so much in it and yet the market just isn’t responding,"" said Rightmer.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article from Fox 2 offers a perspective on the challenges faced by automakers due to changes in presidential administration policy, particularly concerning electric vehicles (EVs).

The arrangement was approved by the IMF Executive Board for a total amount of SDR 2.3 billion (about US$3 billion) on March 20, 2023. “The staff-level agreement is subject to the approval by IMF management and the IMF Executive Board, contingent on: (i) the implementation by the authorities of prior actions including the submission of a 2025 budget consistent with program objectives; and (ii) the completion of financing assurances review, which will focus on confirming multilateral partners’ committed financing contributions and whether adequate progress has been made with the debt restructuring to give confidence that the restructuring will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the program’s debt targets. “Upon completion of the Executive Board review, Sri Lanka would have access to SDR 254 million (about US$333 million), bringing the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement to SDR 1,016 million (about US$1,333 million). “Sri Lanka’s ambitious reform agenda supported by the EFF is delivering commendable outcomes. The economy expanded on average by 4 percent y-o-y in the four quarters ending in June 2024. High-frequency indicators point to continued expansion across all sectors. Average headline and core inflation remained contained at 0.8 and 3.8 percent during the third quarter. Gross official reserves increased to US$6.4 billion at end-October 2024 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the Central Bank. Public finances have strengthened following substantial fiscal reforms. “Program performance was strong, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets (IT) for end-June 2024 met, as well as the ITs for end-September 2024, except for the IT on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due before October-2024 were either met or implemented with delay; some benchmarks are delayed because of the election cycle. “The new government’s commitment to the program objectives has enhanced confidence and ensures policy continuity. Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguarding the hard-won gains of the program and putting the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth. Since the crisis has affected Sri Lanka’s entire population, it will be important to ensure that the benefits from economic growth are shared appropriately. “Maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring debt sustainability are key to securing Sri Lanka’s prosperity and require persevering with responsible fiscal policy. Continued revenue mobilization efforts and spending restraint are needed to prepare the 2025 budget in line with program parameters. Revenue administration reforms and efforts to improve tax compliance will help to ensure that the burden stemming from the crisis is shared proportionately to taxpayers’ ability to contribute. Avoiding new tax exemptions will help reduce fiscal revenue leakages, corruption risks and build much needed fiscal buffers, including for social spending and to support Sri Lanka’s most vulnerable. Maintaining cost recovery in fuel and electricity pricing and resolving legacy debts will help minimize fiscal risks arising from state-owned enterprises. “The government has an important responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable at this difficult time. It is important to redouble efforts to meet the program’s minimum spending target on social spending and to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets, particularly Aswesuma. “While inflation has decelerated faster than expected, continued monitoring is warranted to ensure sustained price stability and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing global uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through strong reserves accumulation. “Sri Lanka’s recent Agreement in Principle with bondholders is an important milestone putting Sri Lanka’s debt on a path towards sustainability. The critical next steps are to complete the commercial debt restructuring, finalize bilateral agreements with official creditors along the lines of the accord with the Official Creditor Committee and implement the terms of the other agreements. This will help restore Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability. “The new government’s mandate will reinvigorate governance reforms addressing corruption risks, rebuilding economic confidence, and making growth more robust and inclusive. “The IMF team held meetings with His Excellency President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Honorable Labor Minister and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Honorable Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Senior Economic Advisor Duminda Hulangamuwa, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. “We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration.”",Uncategorized,bing,"The article's title and description suggest it will discuss the misuse of permits for Sri Lankan migrant workers to import electric vehicles, potentially a unique and relevant issue within the sphere of electric vehicles.

Dorset Coroner’s Court heard in a statement from Allison Whitney, James’ wife that her husband loved to socialise with his friends and loved DIY projects. She also said she always called him Jim. On the morning of September 12, Mrs Whitney recalled making breakfast for her husband and watching him leave for work at 8.10am. She said that was the last time she saw her husband. In the statement provided by Mrs Whitney she said the week leading up to James going missing was “uneventful” and seemed “pretty normal”. She said this was “unusual behaviour” and “completely out of character” for him. Dorset Coroner’s Court also heard in a statement from James’ business partner and friend, Darren Henderson, that they had been friends for 18/19 years. James worked as an architect and started a business with Mr Henderson in 2008. It was reported James was last seen at his workplace in Christchurch at around 1pm on September 12. Upon James leaving work, Mr Henderson contacted Mrs Whitney, stating he was concerned for James’ welfare. After Mrs Whitley’s attempts to contact her husband, she contacted Dorset Police at 4.31pm. James was expected to be playing football at 6pm with others; however, he did not show up. After the location of Swanage was accessed from his phone, Mrs Whitney began to drive around and search for her husband. James' vehicle was found in a layby in Ulwell Road in Swanage at 8.34pm on September 12. The car’s engine was cold, and James’ belongings were still inside, including his phone. As reported previously by the Daily Echo, the HM Coastguard, an NPAS helicopter and Dorset Search and Rescue were all involved in the search. After searching through the night and the morning of September 13, the body of James Whitney was found near Old Harry Rocks shortly after midday. A post-mortem examination conducted by Dr Stolte found James’ cause of death to be ‘multiple injuries’ sustained from a fall from a cliff. Assistant coroner for Dorset, Richard Middleton, concluded James died from suicide. When life is difficult, Samaritans are here – day or night, 365 days a year.

However, considering the evaluation dimension of Clarity, Engagement, and Structure, there are several points to critique. 

Firstly, the clarity and organization of the article can be improved. The article jumps directly into specifications and technical details without a proper introduction that sets the context or goals for these updates, which might disengage readers unfamiliar with the models. Although it contains numerous technical specifications, these could benefit from clearer subheadings or sections that help break down the information into more digestible pieces for the reader.

Regarding engagement, while it provides detailed information on updates to ergonomics, suspension, and rider aids, it lacks engaging narratives or explanations about how these improvements might affect the riding experience. Adding insights or testimonials from real-world testing or comparisons to previous models could make the article more engaging and informative, particularly for potential buyers.

The structure is somewhat linear without much variability or supporting visuals apart from a single introductory image, making it less engaging for readers who prefer more diverse content formats. Including diagrams, comparison tables, or side-by-side changes between the 2024 and 2025 models could enhance clarity and engagement.

Moreover, the article maintains a neutral tone without exaggerated claims, staying focused on factual updates without overstating performance improvements or environmental benefits, which is a positive aspect.

The imposing camouflaged sedan looks to rival the likes of Lamborghini and Maserati, among others. The United Kingdom-based carmaker has released the images. Jaguar shocks the world with fully electric car The Jaguar full electric car edition is yet to be identified as far as its model but some reviewers say it will be called I-type. The full EV car plans to shake the market as it looks to rival top-of-the-range cars such as Maserati and Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini. As imposing and massive as it is, the car is somewhere between a four-door coupe and a shooting brake, there’s no doubt this entirely camouflaged prototype is our first look at Jaguar’s future. Published by the company, the first images of the prototype car were seen undergoing test sessions in England. According to motor1.com, this will be the first in what Jaguar calls its “new species” of high-end vehicles. It will be shown on December 2 in Art Week Miami alongside three additional concept cars as part of the brand’s hard “reset.” Jaguar to transform competition in the EV space The car publication reports that the sedan carmaker is looking to transform from a “premium” brand competing with the likes of Audi and BMW, into a high-end automaker alongside alternatives like Maserati and Porsche. The technology and performance will improve, and the price, as expected, will go up. Initial costs will be somewhere in the $130,000 to $140,000 mark. Arguably even more important, though, will be the brand’s design revolution. The car boasts a substantial presence on the road. “In terms of proportions, it is very far from what we do today. To get there, I divided the design team into three groups. Within three months they produced 17 full-size models with different design languages, some were familiar, others looked like something out of science fiction movies,” reports motor1. “The design language we chose is exuberant. Just think of something that will be different on the road. And in December we will unveil our new design language. “The photos suggest the final product of the car will have a very long nose and an incredibly high beltline. And even though it has a “grille,” this car will be 100% electric—so it’s mostly for show.” Will the new Jaguar be called an I-type? Caranddriver reports that a recent U.S. trademark application indicates that they could be I-type—this makes sense given that Jaguar’s first EV effort was branded I-Place. While that Jaguar SUV model’s production abruptly ended in 2024, and while it made a splash when it debuted, its 240-mile driving range meant it lagged behind newer rivals in recent years. What will the Jaguar I-type offer? Based on speculation from car review gurus and publications, the imposing car will come with unique features. “Whether or not it gets the name I-type, the new model should offer at least 300 miles of driving per charge, and we suspect it will come with two motors and offer all-wheel drive,” writes Drew Dorian. “Jaguar hasn’t commented on the powertrain specs, but we know the car will ride on a new electrical architecture. “Pricing is also unknown, but given Jaguar’s ambitions to move upmarket, we think the I-type will likely require a six-figure outlay.” Even though it’s still camouflaged, Jaguar’s first high-end EV already looks promising. The big question is: Will it compete against the industry’s big guns, only time will tell once the car hits the market.",Uncategorized,bing,"This article provides an insight into Jaguar's entry into the electric vehicle market with a new, high-end model, potentially called the I-type.

(WSVN) - More than 1,000 residents in a Coral Gables neighborhood are without power after a power line snapped and fell on top of two cars, sparking a fire. Officials said the cars caught on fire near Ferdinand Street off Southwest 57th Avenue when a live wire snapped and fell on top of them, at around 6 a.m. on Friday. Neighbors were stunned by what they saw. “They knocking our door at 5 o’clock in the morning, and everybody have to come out,” said Maria Mora. “Then I heard all the sparking and snapping of the power lines,” said Maxine Longer. “My one of my sons said, ‘Dad, I think the car is on fire’, you know, just over there,” said Brian Ahmes, “and I looked out his window, flames were everywhere.” Coral Gables Fire Rescue and crews from Florida Power & Light arrived at the scene, ultimately making a split-second decision to shut down the power grid to prevent the fire from spreading further. “Our crews made a quick decision to shut down the FPL power grid in order to save the house, because at that time, the fire was extending into the house,” said Coral Gables Fire Rescue Lt. Ishmael Roig. The grid was shut down for several hours while crews worked to contain the fire. “Electricity conducts water, so that would be of harm to our firefighters and the occupants inside the home. It would put a lot of us in danger,” said Roig. Inside the home, homeowner Laude McDonald and her husband were sleeping, but no one was hurt, and only a portion of the garage was damaged by the flames. McDonald, who did not want to show her face on camera, recounted the terrifying moments for 7News. “But it’s kind of scary, because the last time, it happened in the middle of the night, too, and you’re sleeping,” she said. “I mean, my husband got up to get an aspirin. That’s how he was able to see what was going on.” McDonald said they’ve had issues with the power lines in this neighborhood before. “They’ve spent months working on that. You would’ve thought that after what happened that they would’ve secured those wires correctly,” said McDonald. Although grateful for their lives, the owners were left devastated about their cars, because they are limited editions. “It’s terrible what happened to them. Now they have no transportation. Damage to their house, and just being totally terrorized,” said Longer. Aerial footage from 7Skyforce showed the severely damaged cars covered in foam with smoke rising from the hotspots. The charred cars were a Honda and a Limited Edition Infiniti that only had about 2,000 miles on them. “My pride and joy, it had 2,000 miles on them,” said McDonald. McDonald and her neighbors are grateful for the firefighters’ swift actions and that no other structures were damaged. “I’m very grateful. It’s very scary,” said McDonald. Although crews were able to contain the fire, the department said it’s not a common occurrence for a power line to snap, and FPL will be investigating further. “This is not a common occurrence. This is not something that happens here every single day. We’re just glad that it didn’t fall on top of somebody and nobody was hurt,” said Roig. According to FPL, they have restored the power for all customers that were impacted. What caused the power line to snap remains under investigation. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

Autofahrer müssen mit höheren Preisen an der Tankstelle rechnen. 2025 gibt es Änderungen bei Benzin und Diesel – sie wirken sich auf die Preise aus Seit 2021 wird eine CO 2 -Steuer erhoben. Diese zusätzliche Abgabe auf Kraftstoffe wie Benzin, Diesel und Erdgas sollte die Nutzung fossiler Energien Schritt für Schritt teurer machen und auf diese Weise den Umstieg auf nachhaltige Alternativen fördern. Die Logik dahinter: Je teurer Benzin oder Diesel, desto eher lohnt sich der Wechsel zum E-Auto. Autofahrer müssen sich 2025 auf höhere Preise für Benzin und Diesel einstellen. Am 1.

Denn kann der reichste Mann der Welt tatsächlich unabhängig sein, wenn er Staatsausgaben kürzt? Medien haben viel über die aufblühende Freundschaft zwischen dem designierten Präsidenten Donald Trump und dem reichsten Mann der Welt, Elon Musk, berichtet. Was zunächst wie eine seltsame Verbindung schien, hat sich zu einer beruflichen Chance für Musk entwickelt. In der vergangenen Woche sah man die beiden in Palm Beach, beim Schwergewichtskampf der Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in New York und Fastfood von McDonald's futternd in einem Jet. Vor der Wahl kündigte Trump an, dass er den in Südafrika geborenen Musk eine Kommission für Regierungseffizienz leiten lassen würde. Letzte Woche machte Trump diese Ankündigung konkreter: Er bestätigte, dass die neue Behörde Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) heißen wird, also ein Ressort namens ""Regierungseffizienz"". Musk bekommt dabei Unterstützung von einem weiteren wohlhabenden Unternehmer: Vivek Ramaswamy. Was ist Musks neue r Job ? Es ist ein ganz neues Ressort, also weiß niemand genau, welche Aufgaben oder welche Befugnisse es umfassen wird. Wahrscheinlich wird es sich um eine kleine beratende Gruppe handeln, die außerhalb der Regierung tätig ist und keine wirklichen Regulierungsbefugnisse hat. Was sie jedoch haben dürfte, ist Einfluss - und ein lautstarkes Sprachrohr in Gestalt von Musk. Das Ressort mit dem dystopischen Namen ""Department of Government Efficiency"" strebt an, die Ausgaben der US-Regierung um 2 Billionen Dollar (1,9 Billionen Euro) zu senken. Der Abbau von Bürokratie, Regulierungen und ""überflüssigen Ausgaben"" soll die US-Regierung nachhaltig entschlacken. Musk wird bei der Leitung von DOGE von Vivek Ramaswamy unterstützt werden, einem anderen reichen Unternehmer Bild: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Musk ist dafür bekannt, die Kosten in seinen eigenen Unternehmen zu senken. Aber das Kürzen von Regierungsausgaben wird eine große Herausforderung. Das Vorhaben soll bis Juli 2026 abgeschlossen werden. ""Musk hat keine wirkliche Erfahrung mit Regierungen, außer dabei sie zu verklagen oder Verschwörungstheorien über sie zu verbreiten"", sagte Donald Moynihan, Professor für öffentliche Verwaltung an der Ford School of Public Policy der Universität Michigan. ""Die US-Regierung muss modernisiert werden, aber alles, worüber Musk spricht, ist Kosten zu senken und Menschen zu bestrafen, mit denen er nicht einverstanden ist"", sagte Moynihan der DW. ""Seine einfache mathematische Gleichung geht aber nicht auf."" 2023 lag das US-Regierungsbudget bei 6,1 Billionen Dollar. Ein Drittel davon floss in die Sozialversicherung und Medicare - Programme, die Trump laut eigenen Aussagen unangetastet lassen will. Laut dem überparteilichen Congressional Budget Office handelt es sich insgesamt nur bei 1,7 Billionen Dollar um Ermessensausgaben, also Ausgaben, die nicht gesetzlich oder vertraglich fixiert sind und durch die Abgeordneten abgelehnt werden könnten. SpaceX und ein milliardenschwerer Interessenkonflikt? Musk sollte bereits mit der Führung seiner sechs Unternehmen wie Tesla, SpaceX und X (ehemals Twitter) ziemlich ausgelastet sein. Die neue Position in der US-Regierung birgt dabei zahlreiche Interessenkonflikte. Insbesondere, weil einige seiner Unternehmen staatliche Subventionen erhalten und zum Teil direkte Verträge mit der US-Regierung bestehen. Das heißt, es handelt sich bei einigen seiner Unternehmen um staatliche Auftragsnehmer. Zudem nutzen Musks Unternehmen auch Innovationen und Technologien, die regulatorische Grenzen sprengen. Musk könnte bald Macht über Regulierungsbehörden besitzen, die eigentlich das Sagen über seine zahlreichen Unternehmen haben, wie etwa Space X Bild: SpaceX/AP/dpa/picture alliance ""Ich kann mich an keinen anderen Fall erinnern, in dem jemand - mit so klaren und offensichtlichen Interessenskonflikten - einem öffentlichen Amtsträger Ratschläge zum Budget, zur Struktur und zur Entlassung von Mitarbeitern erteilt, obwohl sie seine Geschäfte direkt betreffen"", sagte Moynihan. ""Das ist geradezu karikaturhaft korrupt.“ Im Laufe der Jahre hat SpaceX Milliarden an den Verträgen mit der NASA und dem Verteidigungsministerium verdient. So etwa für den Start von Satelliten, die Versorgung der Internationalen Raumstation oder der Nutzung des Starlink-Satellitennetzwerks. In den letzten zehn Jahren beliefen sich diese SpaceX-Verträge auf mehr als 15 Milliarden Dollar, wie die New York Times errechnete. Allein im letzten Jahr schlossen Musks Unternehmen 100 verschiedene Verträge mit 17 US-Regierungsbehörden im Gesamtwert von 3 Milliarden Dollar ab. Weitere Interessenkonflikte? Musk hat eine ganze Serie von öffentlichen Auseinandersetzungen mit US-Regierungsbehörden und anderen Regulierungsbehörden hinter sich. Eine Untersuchung durch die US-Börsenaufsicht SEC führte 2018 zu einer Anklage wegen Wertpapierbetrugs. Musks Rücktritt als Vorsitzender von Tesla war Teil der späteren Einigung. Tesla hat enorme Steuererleichterungen und andere Anreize von verschiedenen US-Staaten erhalten. Auf US-Regierungsebene hat Tesla zwar nur kleinere Regierungsaufträge zur Lieferung einiger Fahrzeuge. Musk könnte Trump jedoch davon überzeugen, Steuervergünstigungen für Elektrofahrzeuge beizubehalten, um den Verkauf zu steigern. Zudem könnte Musk darauf drängen, Zölle bei Konkurrenten zu erhöhen, die Fahrzeuge in Mexiko oder anderswo herstellen. Und das ist längst nicht alles: Musk könnte die Aufsichtsbehörden beeinflussen, die Teslas Vorstoß zum selbstfahrenden Auto genauer unter die Lupe nehmen wollen. Ebenso könnte er versuchen, Emissionsregelungen beizubehalten, die es Tesla ermöglichen, Umweltgutschriften im Wert von Milliarden Dollar an andere Autohersteller zu verkaufen, die nicht genügend Elektrofahrzeuge produzieren. Bei den anderen Musk-Unternehmen - xAI, The Boring Co, Neuralink und X - bestehen zwar keine Verträge mit der US-Regierung. Das ändert aber nichts daran, dass es die Möglichkeit gäbe von der Nähe zu Trump zu profitieren. Die Nähe würde dabei helfen, künstliche Intelligenz voranzutreiben oder auch den Social-Media-Konkurrenten TikTok zu blockieren. Ein plötzliches Ende der ungewöhnlichen Freundschaft? Trump ist nicht der erste Präsident, der versucht Ausgaben zu kürzen oder Effizienz-Experten hinzuziehen. Doch der Unterschied ist diesmal, wen der designierte Präsident einbezieht und welche Möglichkeiten der persönlichen Bereicherung es dabei gibt. Bisher äußerte sich Trump vorsichtig und betonte, dass Musk kein offizieller Teil der Exekutive sein würde und nur ""außerhalb der Regierung Ratschläge und Anleitungen geben und mit dem Weißen Haus und dem Office of Management & Budget zusammenarbeiten würde, um umfassende Strukturreformen voranzutreiben.“ Dies ist entscheidend, denn das Bundesgesetz verbietet es Personen, sich an Regierungsangelegenheiten zu beteiligen, bei denen ein finanzielles Eigeninteresse besteht. Aber, ganz egal wie Musks offizieller Titel lauten wird - große Kürzungen benötigen letztendlich die Unterstützung und Zustimmung des Kongresses. Das heißt, trotz allem werden die Abgeordneten am Ende die endgültige Entscheidung treffen. Unter Strich bleibt der unberechenbarste Teil bei dem Ganzen Trump selbst. Er ist dafür bekannt, Lieblinge auszuwählen und sie plötzlich fallen zu lassen. Und den reichsten Mann der Welt fallen zu lassen, könnte eines Tages der Ego-Boost schlechthin für Trump sein. Unabhängig davon, wie Musks offizieller Titel lautet: Der Kongress kontrolliert letztendlich die Geldmittel Bild: J. Scott Applewhite/AP/dpa/picture alliance Trump und Musk seien zwei große Persönlichkeiten, die das Rampenlicht lieben, sagt Moynihan, doch Trump könne es nicht ertragen, in den Schatten gestellt zu werden. ""Diese ungewöhnliche Beziehung aufrechtzuerhalten, wird ungefähr so schwierig sein, wie Billionen zu kürzen."" ""In gewisser Weise könnte die Berufung Musks in ein Beratungsgremium als Herabstufung angesehen werden, da nicht klar ist, ob es überhaupt etwas bewirken wird"", bringt es Donald Moynihan auf den Punkt.

This innovative technology is revolutionizing how we think about heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in cars. We’ve seen a significant shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric ones, and with this change comes a whole new approach to keeping passengers comfortable while maximizing energy efficiency. There’s been a considerable increase in compressor technology for electric vehicle HVAC systems. The heart of these systems is the electric compressor, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cabin comfort and optimizing energy efficiency. Unlike traditional belt-driven compressors, electric compressors offer variable speed control, allowing for precise adjustment based on cooling demands. This flexibility results in improved energy management and reduced power consumption. One of the most promising advancements is scroll compressor technology. These compressors feature two interleaved spiral components – a stationary fixed scroll and a moving scroll that orbits around it. This design has a big impact on efficiency and smooth operation, generating less vibration and noise compared to traditional reciprocating compressors. The compact size and lightweight nature of scroll compressors make them ideal for electric vehicles, where space and weight savings are crucial. There have been significant strides in heating systems for electric vehicles as well. One innovative solution is the heat pump. This system transfers heat from outside the car, reducing battery drain. It’s 2-3 times more efficient than traditional heating methods, even in temperatures approaching -20°F. Heat pumps can help EVs recover 3-15% of range lost in cold weather. The High Voltage Heater (HVH) has emerged as a game-changer. This compact device, offers impressive efficiency. Unlike heat pumps, it uses water heating instead of air heating. The HVH can maintain cabin comfort and preheat the traction engine. It works with a wide range of voltages (100-450V) and delivers up to 7 kW of heating power. These advancements are crucial for addressing the cold-weather range reduction challenge in EVs, especially in cold climates. By optimizing heating efficiency, manufacturers are tackling ‘range anxiety’ and making electric vehicles more practical for everyday use. The electric vehicle HVAC system plays a big part in keeping batteries at the right temperature. Batteries work best between 59°F and 86°F, with less than 10°F difference across the pack. Going outside this range can hurt performance and even cause safety issues. That’s why an efficient battery thermal management system is essential. The HVAC system works with the battery cooling system to optimize performance. By managing battery temperature this extends range, helps improve charging, and boosts overall efficiency of electric vehicles.

It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said. Someone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year. “Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.” The carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars. During the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery. Demand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable. The carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks. Under the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035. The mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen. For the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway. View image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge The Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate. Yet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require. Vicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said. “We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla). With all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate. Ben Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%. Carmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs. The business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals. Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers. “The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said. Whatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are. David Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",,rss,"The article provides an insightful analysis into the challenges faced by car manufacturers due to the UK's stringent electric vehicle (EV) sales mandates.

Steigender CO2-Preis: Wie sehr verteuert er die Spritpreise?,"Auch 2025 steigt der CO2-Preis – bis 2026 ist festgelegt, wie sehr er Benzin und Diesel verteuert. Ab 2027 drohen beim Sprit dann massive Preissteigerungen!",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/co2-preis-wie-massiv-der-spritpreis-steigt-15123801.html,,2024-11-22 16:21:00,Matthias Brügge,,"Wer jetzt ein neues Auto kauft, der sollte mit steigenden Kosten für fossile Energieträger planen. Nicht jeder tut das, hat es den Anschein – Monat für Monat rollen immer noch jede Menge neue Verbrenner auf die Straße. Der Anteil der Käufer reiner E-Autos sank von 16,1 Prozent im Jahresdurchschnitt 2023 auf 11,4 Prozent von Januar bis März 2024. Das bedeutet: Aktuell wählen 88,6 Prozent aller Neuwagenkäufer ein Fahrzeug, das auf Sicht mit fossilem Treibstoff betankt wird. Nur: Wie sich der Spritpreis entwickelt, ist völlig unsicher. Ein gerade wenig diskutiertes Thema ist die immer weiter steigende CO 2 -Abgabe, die auch CO 2 -Preis oder CO 2 -Steuer genannt wird. Sie bedeutet für die Zukunft laufend steigende Spritpreise. Schon jetzt wirft der künftige CO 2 -Preis seinen Schatten voraus, sein Anstieg wird bei langfristigen Gasverträgen schon einkalkuliert, denn die Versorger müssen schon dessen ungewisse Höhe mitberechnen. Die Folge: stark ansteigende Gastarife in langfristigen Verträgen, wie das ""Handelsblatt"" berichtet. Anzeige THG-Quoten-Prämie Einfach Geld verdienen mit dem E-Auto Die Prämienplattform Elektrovorteil garantiert 85 Euro THG-Quote (2024) für die Registrierung Ihres E-Fahrzeugs (inkl. 5 Euro AUTO BILD-Bonus). Zum Angebot Zum Angebot In Kooperation mit Wie hängen CO 2 -Abgabe und Spritpreis zusammen? Die seit 2021 erhobene Abgabe verteuert fossile Treibstoffe wie Benzin und Diesel, aber auch LGP sowie Erdgas. Denn die Abgabe hat das Ziel, fossile Energieträger wie Kohle, Benzin oder Erdgas preislich weniger attraktiv zu machen, damit weniger verbrannt wird. Dahinter steht die Absicht, die Klimaerwärmung erst zu verringern und schließlich zu stoppen. Darum verteuert der CO 2 -Preis ausschließlich fossile Brennstoffe, der Umfang wird in Deutschland geregelt durch das Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz. Wie sehr verteuert die CO 2 -Abgabe Benzin und Diesel? 2 -Preises um 10 Euro pro Tonne verteuert Sprit laut ADAC rein rechnerisch um rund 3 Cent pro Liter. Ob und wie stark die Erhöhung weitergegeben wird, hängt von der Kalkulation der Mineralölkonzerne ab. 2024 verteuerte die CO 2 -Abgabe den Ein Anheben des CO-Preises um 10 Euro pro Tonne verteuert Sprit laut ADAC rein rechnerisch um rund 3 Cent pro Liter. Ob und wie stark die Erhöhung weitergegeben wird, hängt von der Kalkulation der Mineralölkonzerne ab. 2024 verteuerte die CO-Abgabe den Benzinpreis pro forma um 4,3 Cent, hat der ADAC errechnet. Das galt auch für Diesel mit einem Aufschlag beim Literpreis um 4,7 Cent. Den Berechnungen zufolge würde der Liter Benzin schon 2026 allein durch die CO 2 -Abgabe um 18,6 Cent teurer werden, Diesel um 20,8 Cent pro Liter. Letzteres könnte immerhin die Nachfrage nach HVO ansteigen lassen, denn der alternative Sprit kostet derzeit rund 20 Cent mehr als fossiler Diesel, ist aber von der CO 2 -Abgabe befreit. Wie sehr verteuert der CO 2 -Preis Sprit im Jahr 2025? Schon 2025 wird der CO 2 -Malus von 45 Euro auf 55 Euro pro Tonne CO 2 erhöht. Das würde einen weiteren Anstieg von weiteren 4,3 Cent pro Liter Benzin und 4,7 Cent für Diesel nach sich ziehen. Wie sich die weiter steigende CO2-Abgabe auf den Spritpreis auswirkt Wie sich die weiter steigende CO2-Abgabe auf den Spritpreis auswirkt Jahr CO2-Preis/Tonne Preisaufschlag/Liter Benzin Preisaufschlag/Liter Diesel 2021 25 Euro ca. 7 Cent ca. 8 Cent 2022 30 Euro ca. 8,4 Cent ca. 9,5 Cent 2023 bleibt bei 30 Euro ca. 8,4 Cent ca. 9,5 Cent 2024 45 Euro ca. 12,7 Cent ca. 14,2 Cent 2025 55 Euro ca. 15,7 Cent ca. 17,2 Cent 2026 55 - 65 Euro ca. 18,6 Cent ca. 20,8 Cent 2027 freie Preisbildung im Emissionshandel noch nicht bekannt noch nicht bekannt Schon im Folgejahr 2026 geht der Anstieg weiter, auf geschätzte 55 bis 65 Euro pro Tonne. Der Betrag wird Diesel und Benzin weiter verteuern. Wie sehr steigt die Abgabe 2027? Das ist die große Unbekannte: Die Bildung des CO 2 -Preises unterliegt laut Plan ab 2027 dem Markt. Ab dann soll sich die Höhe der Abgabe aus dem Verkauf von Emissionszertifikaten an der Börse ergeben. Wie sehr wird der Preis steigen? Heute völlig offen. Schlimmer noch: Nach 2026 hat die Politik aller Voraussicht nach keinen Einfluss mehr auf die Höhe der Abgabe. Droht damit eine CO 2 -Zeitbombe? Und welches Risiko gehen Autokäufer mit dem Erwerb eines Verbrenners ein? Eine Frage, die sich derzeit nicht seriös beantworten lässt. 2 fällig werden könnten. Wenn das eintritt, würde sich Sprit um saftige 38 Cent pro Liter verteuern! Es gibt aber Studien . Eine vom Berliner Klima-Thinktank MCC errechnete, dass bei steigender Nachfrage nach Diesel und Benzin sowie fossilem Gas oder Heizöl schon 2027 mehr als 200 Euro pro Tonne COfällig werden könnten. Wenn das eintritt, würde sich Sprit um saftige 38 Cent pro Liter verteuern! Zoom CO 2 ist hauptverantwortlich für die Erwärmung der Erdatmosphäre und damit für den Klimawandel. Bild: Jan Paul Kupser Das wird immer wahrscheinlicher, da die Klimaziele der EU immer weiter verschärft werden und mit weiteren Maßnahmen zur Energiewende zu rechnen ist. Schon 2040, so der heutige Plan, soll der Ausstoß von Treibhausgasen in Europa um 88 Prozent sinken. Und bereits 2045 ist die CO 2 -Neutralität geplant – dann darf nicht mehr Treibhausgas ausgestoßen werden, als mit künstlichen Mitteln gebunden werden kann. Immerhin: Das ist noch recht lange hin. Zoom Seit Mitte 2024 steigen Benzin- und Dieselpreis wieder, unklar ist der weitere Verlauf. Bild: ADAC Mit welchem Anstieg der CO 2 -Abgabe ist 2030 zu rechnen? Im weiteren Verlauf hängt der Preis dann von der Nachfrage nach Emissionszertifikaten ab, wie auch vom Bedarf der rohölproduzierenden bzw. -verarbeitenden Firmen. Auch dafür gibt es schon Berechnungen: Eine konservative wissenschaftliche Prognose stammt vom Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung (PIK). Laut seinen Berechnungen könnte der CO 2 -Preis bis 2030 auf 120 Euro und bis 2050 auf 400 Euro pro Tonne steigen. 400 Euro pro Tonne wären das Neunfache von heute – ein Aufschlag auf den Literpreis von 1,20 Euro, allein für CO 2 ! Benzin könnte 3 Euro pro Liter kosten Aus heutiger Sicht, ohne Einberechnen von Inflation und aller weiteren preistreibenden Faktoren, müsste der Liter Sprit dann also 3 Euro kosten. Das entspräche, auf heutige Preise angewandt, im Schnitt jährlichen Mehrkosten in Höhe von 1170 Euro für durchschnittliche Autofahrer (bei einem Durchschnittsverbrauch von 7,5 Litern/100 km und einer Jahresfahrleistung von 13.000 km). Sollte die Abgabe Sprit auf 4 Euro pro Liter verteuern, läge die Mehrbelastung bei 2145 Euro – pro Jahr. Es gibt auch schon Untersuchungen, die den Tonnenpreis CO 2 schon 2027 bei über 100 Euro sehen. Bis 2030 veranschlagt das Klima- und Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitut MCC in Berlin einen Anstieg auf 200 Euro bis 300 Euro pro Tonne. Die Ungewissheit ist also groß. Was passiert mit dem Geld aus der Abgabe? Das Geld fließt dem Klima- und Transformationsfonds (KTF) zu. Zuletzt hatte das Bundesverfassungsgericht den Haushalt im November 2023 für verfassungswidrig erklärt und damit die Finanzierung des KTF gekippt. Als Gegenmaßnahme hat die Regierung den CO 2 -Preis stärker angehoben. Kommt ein weiterer, noch ungeplanter Anstieg? Das liegt in Händen der Politik. Zoom Der Straßenverkehr mit seinem CO 2 -Ausstoß ist eine der wichtigsten Stellschrauben beim Erreichen der Klimaziele. Bild: DPA Wie hoch war die CO 2 -Abgabe zum Start? Zum Start der CO 2 -Abgabe wurde der Ausstoß einer Tonne Klimagas mit 25 Euro belegt. Im Gegenzug für die Abgabe erhalten die Produzenten von CO 2 , zum Beispiel Kraftwerke, Emissionszertifikate. Die sind vergleichbar mit den Zertifikaten, die im Rahmen der THG-Quote gehandelt werden. 2 -Abgabe steigt in festen Schritten. Im zweiten Abgabejahr 2022 kostete die Tonne CO 2 bereits 30 Euro. 2023 war wegen der Energiekrise durch den Ukraine-Krieg ein Ausnahmejahr, die Abgabe blieb bei 30 Euro je Tonne Kohlenstoffdioxid. Besitzer von Elektroautos und Elektrorollern können mit dem Verkauf von THG-Zertifikaten Geld verdienen , kommen dadurch etwas günstiger davon. Die CO-Abgabe steigt in festen Schritten.

Das kann man tatsächlich. Denn der CO 2 -Gehalt beispielsweise von LPG-Gas liegt um 21 Prozent niedriger als Benzin und um 23 Prozent unter dem von Diesel, argumentiert das Branchenportal Flüssiggas.

Known as Koru, the sea vessel is one of the world’s most prestigious superyachts. Unlike other modern sea vessels, Bezos’s Koru is a three-masted sailing yacht, which makes it stand out from the rest. When commissioned, it was the second-largest sailing yacht in the world. DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie Jeff Bezos’ $500M superyacht sets sail The superyacht recently arrived in the Bay of Palma and spent a few days cruising in Mallorcan waters. The last time the yacht came to Palma was two years ago on her maiden voyage. Sail Trip Mallorca Back then, both Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez arrived on the Spanish island by private jet. They then took a helicopter to Koru’s support ship, the Abeona, and then a fast launch to the mega-yacht. Speaking of the $75 million support vessel, it offers additional crew accommodation, a helipad, and storage for supplies. The couple also spent a few days cruising in Mallorcan waters before heading to the South of France where they got engaged. Why is it out on the sea? It is unclear whether Bezos or Sanchez are onboard during this voyage of the Koru. It is highly likely that the crew is just performing routine trials on her equipment. The annual cost to maintain a superyacht and its support vessel doesn’t come cheap, either. The Koru and her support vessel Abeona cost approximately $25 million and $10 million per year.

Die induktiv ladende Halterung ist schnell und einfach angebracht, passt für die meisten Ausströmer-Lamellen und lässt sich einfach und in hinreichend flexiblem Maße justieren. Wird sie nicht gebraucht, nimmt sie so gut wie keinen Platz im Handschuhfach in Anspruch. Mit knapp 32 Euro ist sie zudem eine der günstigsten Halterungen im Test und kommt ohne Plastik in der Verpackung ins Haus. Verbatim FCW-01 2,1 gut Verbatim FCW-01 2,1 gut Zwei Halterungen: Lüftung und Saugnapf für die Scheibe Sehr günstig Gute Verarbeitung Montage nicht an allen Lüftungs-Typen möglich Relativ niedrige Ladeleistung Bildschirm auf unebener Straße mitunter schwer abzulesen Zum Angebot Zum Anbieter Der Preis-Leistungs-Sieger von Verbatim kommt auf 151 Punkte, die ebenfalls für ein ""gut"" reichen. Die FCW-01 kostet nur 23,74 Euro und kann im Grunde alles, was auch die besser platzierten Halterungen mit Ladefunktion können. Abstriche muss man bei der Ladeleistung machen, die im Test etwa für ein iPhone 13 nur bei fünf Watt lag. Zudem kommt sie mit Erschütterungen nicht so gut klar, wie die meisten anderen Modelle, die Lesbarkeit leidet auf unebener Strecke teils deutlich. Die Verbatim FCW-01 lädt die getesteten iPhones (XS und 13) nur mit maximal fünf Watt, das können viele andere besser. In der Qualitätsanmutung muss es jedoch keinen Vergleich scheuen. Zoom Handyhalterungen, die in die Lüftungsdüsen gesteckt werden, sind nicht mit jedem Auto kompatibel. Bild: Ralf Timm/AUTO BILD Nach dem Auspacken der Halterungen ging es sogleich an die Montage: Wie intuitiv lassen sie sich in Betrieb nehmen? Hilft die Anleitung, falls doch etwas unklar ist? Wie schnell und einfach ist das Handy einzusetzen und wieder herauszunehmen? Bei den Tests kamen die folgenden Geräte zum Einsatz: (iPhone XS, 12 und 13). Geprüft wurde zudem, ob die Halterungen in mehreren Autos verwendet werden können und wie viel Raum sie für das zeitweise Verstauen etwa im Handschuhfach einnehmen. Zoom Mit jeder Handyhalterung wurde dieselbe Teststrecke abgefahren. Neben innerstädtischem Verkehr war auch eine holprige Kopfsteinpflaster-Strecke dabei. Bild: Roland Kontny/AUTO BILD Beim eigentlichen Gebrauch der Halterungen ging es bei der Bewertung vor allem um die Aspekte Flexibilität und Sicherheit: Wie stark schränken sie das Sichtfeld des Fahrers ein? Wie gut sind die Halterungen am Auto und das Handy wiederum an der Halterung fixiert? Wie flexibel lässt sich das Mobiltelefon justieren, wie einfach oder kompliziert ist das, und wie gut ist der Bildschirm des Handys auf ebener und unebener Fahrbahn abzulesen? Dafür spulten die Testfahrzeuge, ein VW Golf IV Variant von 2001 und ein aktueller Dacia Jogger, zwei verschiedene Strecken über Kopfsteinpflaster und eine typische innerstädtische Strecke ab.

Zoom Eine Power Station gab Aufschluss über die tatsächliche Ladeleistungen der einzelnen Systeme. Bild: Roland Kontny/AUTO BILD Um die Ladeleistung der einzelnen Halterungen zu ermitteln, wurden sie an eine Power Station angeschlossen, die die jeweilige Leistungsaufnahme anzeigt. So konnten die absoluten Leistungen verglichen und das Erreichen der angegebene Ladeleistung überprüft werden. Der dritte Abschnitt des Prüfkatalogs bezog sich auf die Qualität und Umweltaspekte: Welchen Eindruck machen Material und Verarbeitung? Sind schon beim Testen erste Verschleißerscheinungen sichtbar? Besteht vielleicht Verletzungsgefahr wegen zu starker Federn oder anderer mechanischer Bauteile? Wie leicht lassen sich die einzelnen Komponenten der Verpackung trennen, und aus welchen Materialien bestehen sie? Insgesamt kann man mit neun der zehn getesteten Halterungen nicht viel falsch machen: Sie laden das Handy auf, halten es fest und geben es wieder frei, wenn sie es sollen. Entsprechend eng liegen die Platzierten beisammen. Es kommt bei der Wahl des Wunschgeräts eher auf persönliche Prioritäten oder das eingesetzte Fahrzeugmodell an. Zoom AUTO BILD hat zehn Handyhalterungen mit Qi-Ladefunktion zwischen 30 und 45 Euro getestet. Bild: Ralf Timm / Auto Bild Völlig universell ist man mit der zweitplatzierten Halterung von Soarun unterwegs, die ebenso wie die Joyroom auf 159 Punkte kommt: Wer mit der Halterung für die Lüftungslamellen nicht klarkommt, findet in jedem Fall einen Platz für den Saugnapf auf der Frontscheibe. Abzug bekam der Halter für die fummelige und schwergängige Klemme für die Lamellenbefestigung, an der man sich durchaus mal den Finger quetschen kann. Das Telefon wird fest von den drei Haltern gegriffen, diverse Verstellmöglichkeiten inklusive Telekop-Auszug ermöglichen eine äußerst flexible Justierung. Es lädt ebenfalls so flott wie die Halterung von Joyroom, die jedoch nur für Lüftungslamellen gedacht ist, aber ebenso fest zupackt. Auf beiden Geräten ist auch bei unebener Fahrbahn das Wichtigste noch hinreichend gut zu abzulesen. Mit nur einem einzigen Punkt weniger (158) folgt der dem Testsieger sehr ähnliche Halter von Belkin. Sein Magnet hielt ein iPhone 13 nicht ganz so fest, zudem störten die Vibrationen auf unebener Fahrbahn das Lesen auf dem Bildschirm stärker. Ansonsten ist auch diese Halterung bedenkenlos zu empfehlen. Im Mittelfeld landen die Halterungen von Sonru, Auckly und der Preis-Leistungs-Sieger von Verbatim. Auch mit ihnen macht man nichts falsch, zudem bringen sie einige Besonderheiten mit sich: Die Sonru-Halterung justiert als einzige im Testfeld das Telefon auch in der Höhe, um die optimale Ladeposition zu finden. Das klappte im Test mit einem iPhone 13 gut, allerdings bleibt das Gerät bei diesem und weiteren Telefonen mit fünf Watt hinter der angegebenen Leistung zurück. Die Halterung von Auckly kommt mit praktischem Zubehör wie Mikrofasertuch und einer selbstklebenden Klemme, an der sich das Kabel, das übrigens bei allen Geräten im Test lang genug ist, einklemmen lässt und so für etwas mehr Ordnung im Cockpit sorgt. Nettes Gimmick: Alle Halterungen, die das Handy seitlich und von unten mit Klemmen halten, haben einen Kondensator im Gehäuse, der genug Strom speichert, um auch bei ausgeschalteter Zündung die Halterung zu entriegeln und das Telefon freizugeben. Etwas weiter hinten landen die ebenfalls noch ""guten"" Halterungen von KPON und UGreen. Erstgenannte hat als einzige einen 12-Volt-Steckadapter mit Schnelllade-Standard im Lieferumfang. Er ist jedoch recht sperrig bei Nichtgebrauch, nach der berührungsempfindlichen Fläche für die Freigabe des Telefons muss man erst mal suchen, und sie lässt das Telefon am stärksten wackeln. Auch die Ladeleistung ist nicht sonderlich hoch: Beim iPhone 13 waren es mickrige zwei Watt. Das kann das UGreen besser, dafür hakt es an anderer Stelle: Die Konstruktion sieht nur die Befestigung am Armaturenbrett hängend vor. Dadurch sitzt es zum einen recht tief, zum anderen muss eine Sockelplatte angeklebt werden. Das sieht nicht hübsch aus und macht eine Mehrfachverwendung unmöglich. Der breite Haken der Befestigung an der Lamelle eines Ausströmers schränkt die Installationsmöglichkeiten auf bestimmte Fahrzeugmodelle ein, und fehlende Gelenke schränken die Einstellmöglichkeiten des Blickwinkels ein. Zoom Während der Fahrt öffnen sich die Klemmen der Halterung von Qoosea und lassen das Handy fallen – das sorgt nicht nur für einen Schreck beim Fahrer, sondern auch für die Note 5,0 (mangelhaft). Bild: Roland Kontny/AUTO BILD Eine fehlt noch: Die Qoosea-Halterung. Sie sieht futuristisch aus und kann ausschließlich in massiven, also nicht ausklappbaren Cupholdern befestigt werden. Das ist stabiler, als man annehmen würde. Jedoch muss sich der Cupholder vor der Schaltung befinden, da sonst der rechte Arm dem Schwanenhals in die Quere kommt und zudem das Handy so weit hinten und unten in der Fahrzeugmitte ist, dass man den Blick zu sehr vom Verkehrsgeschehen löst. Als einziges Gerät hat es keinen USB-C-, sondern einen Micro-USB-Anschluss. Der abgewinkelte Stecker des mitgelieferten Kabels wackelt jedoch fürchterlich in seinem Steckplatz. Hier scheinen Verschleißschäden programmiert. Eine fehlt noch: Die Qoosea-Halterung.

Die Automatik für das Öffnen und Schließen der Halterung ist offensichtlich zu empfindlich, was dafür sorgt, dass das Telefon jederzeit herausfallen kann. Das führt zu einer Abwertung auf die Note ""mangelhaft"" – denn ein Halter, der nicht hält, ist einfach kein Halter.

Die Nutzung von elektronischen Geräten im Auto ist nur erlaubt, wenn sie entweder fest eingebaut sind, per Sprache bedient werden können oder in einer Halterung stecken. Wer sein Handy also als Navigationssystem nutzen will, kann das nur legal tun, wenn es dafür nicht in die Hand genommen werden muss. Nützliches Wissen rund um induktive Handyhalterungen Welches ist die beste Handyhalterung mit induktiver Ladefunktion? Zehn Handyhalterungen mit induktiver Landefunktion traten beim AUTO BILD Qi-Handyhalter (2023) zum Test an. Mit 161 von 190 Punkten und der Note 1,8 (gut) wurde der Varta Mag Pro Wireless Car Charger Testsieger. Die Handyhalterung überzeugt nicht nur mit einer hochwertigen Verarbeitung und einer einfachen Installation, sondern auch mit einer guten Ladeleistung. Wie viel kostet ein gutes Qi-Ladegerät fürs Auto? AUTO BILD hat zehn induktive Handyhalterungen zwischen 23 und 45 Euro getestet. Die billigste Qi-Handyhalterung im Test ist die Verbatim FCW-01. Sie überzeugt im Test durch zwei mögliche Befestigungsarten (Lüftungsdüse und Saugnapf) und mit einer guten Verarbeitung. Mit 151 von 190 Punkten erhält der Qi-Handyhalter die Note 2,1 (gut) und wird dank des günstigen Preises von 23,74 Euro der Preis-Leistungs-Sieger des AUTO BILD-Qi-Handyhalter-Test. Wie funktioniert induktives Laden? Die Funktionsweise des induktiven Ladens lässt sich recht einfach erklären: Im Ladegerät befindet sich eine Spule, die – wenn sie an das Stromnetz angeschlossen wurden – durch den Wechselstrom ein Magnetfeld erzeugt. Auch in Qi-fähigen Handys befindet sich auf der Rückseite eine Spule, die durch das Magnetfeld dann ebenfalls Strom erzeugt. Durch Schaltungen wird der Strom im Handy zu Gleichstrom gewandelt, der dann den Akku lädt.

The Japanese automaker, which operates Britain's largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don't manufacture in the UK. The move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you'd like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk Nissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate's 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations. Missing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry. Guillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: ""Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. ""The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. ""We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector."" Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an ""urgent need"" to protect the sector.

Werksschließungen und Stellenabbau sind die Schreckgespenster der Gegenwart und Zukunft. Milliarden sollen gespart werden, um einen Turnaround zu schaffen und irgendwann in die Erfolgsspur zurückzukehren. Doch der Weg dahin ist weit und beschwerlich. Für die Beschäftigten gibt es aber auch gute Nachrichten: Rund um Weihnachten klingelt bei vielen die Kasse, denn eine Sonderzahlung soll es trotz der Krise geben. Tarifbonus bei VW Bei Volkswagen gibt es zwar kein klassisches Weihnachtsgeld, dafür aber einen Tarifbonus. Heißt: Arbeitnehmer profitieren von einer Ergebnisbeteiligung, die im kommenden Jahr ausgeschüttet wird. Das besagt der Haustarif, der von VW allerdings gekündigt wurde. 2024 ist aber noch nicht davon betroffen. Wie wird der Tarifbonus gemessen? Es kommt dabei auf das operative Ergebnis der Marken VW Pkw und VW Nutzfahrzeuge an. Die rund 120.000 Tarifbeschäftigten erhalten dann rund zehn Prozent dieses Ergebnisses. Entschieden wird das nach dem letzten Quartal. Bei Audi wird das Weihnachtsgeld ""wie jedes Jahr nach der Logik des Flächentarifvertrags ausgezahlt“, erklärte eine Sprecherin bei der ""Automobilwoche"". Auf die Beschäftigten warten demnach 25 bis 55 Prozent eines Bruttomonatsgehalts. Porsche zahlt bis zu 100 Prozent Porsche wird nichts ändern, trotz der aktuellen Krisenzeiten. Heißt: Der Autobauer aus Zuffenhausen zahlt die 55 Prozent Sonderzahlung plus eine Aufstockung auf bis zu 100 Prozent. ""Die Porsche AG zahlt ihren Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern im November 2024 ein Weihnachtsgeld in Höhe von bis zu 100 Prozent eines Monatsentgelts. Bis zu 55 Prozent davon beruhen auf den tariflichen Regelungen. Das Weihnachtsgeld erhalten 23.300 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter der Porsche AG"", erklärt ein Sprecher.

BMW Introduces 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR,"<div><img src=""https://www.roadracingworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/P90579157_highRes_1732286847.jpg"" style=""width: 100%;"" /><div>BMW Introduces 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR, featuring new technical and styling upgrades and significantly extended standard equipment.</div></div>",https://www.roadracingworld.com/news/bmw-introduces-2025-f-900-r-and-f-900-xr/,,2024-11-22 14:52:31,Michael Gougis,,"BMW Motorrad USA proudly presents the updated 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR. The new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR benefit from technical and visual upgrades as well as from significantly extended standard equipment. With the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad takes its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new F 900 R focuses on sporty riding, the F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on both windy roads and on longer tours with luggage. “With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 6.6 lbs., we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the F 900 XR from optimized aerodynamics.” Anton Huber, Project Manager Engine and Drivetrain The new F 900 R and F 900 XR are even more dynamic and safer thanks to the new “Dynamic” riding mode and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), now standard. In the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested 895 cc two-cylinder in-line engine produces 105 hp and 68.6 lb-ft over a wide torque curve, while meeting current Euro 5+ homologation standards. With a 270/450 degree firing interval, the engine generates a very emotional exhaust note. The new sports silencer, available as a genuine BMW Motorrad Accessory in collaboration with Akrapovič, provides an even more expressive exhaust sound. The F 900 R and F 900 XR are offered with two standard riding modes, Rain and Road. The optional Dynamic riding mode has received new settings. It has a throttle response curve that is more direct, making it ideal for sporty riding. Dynamic Traction Control DTC, which ensures a high level of riding safety, is also a new standard feature on both models. It contributes significantly to the high riding dynamics and exemplary riding safety. DTC provides valuable support and a significant safety advantage, especially in changing riding conditions, on surfaces with less grip and surfaces with changing friction. The engine control unit detects a spinning rear wheel by comparing the speeds of the front and rear wheels via the ABS sensors with data from the lean angle sensor box. In this case, it reduces drive torque within milliseconds by reducing the ignition timing, intervening in the fuel injection system, and influencing the throttle position. DTC also uses a sensor cluster to measure the lean angle and takes this into account in its control behavior. DTC works with the different riding modes to ensure maximum riding safety. DTC provides valuable assistance and an enormous safety advantage when accelerating. However, it cannot redefine the physical limits of riding. It is still possible to exceed these limits through misjudgment or riding errors. However, DTC helps to make the most of the bike’s dynamic capabilities in a much safer manner. The DTC can be switched off separately for special requirements, such as riding on the track. In addition to the anti-hopping clutch, the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR now feature standard MSR Engine Drag Torque Control. This system prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety. Chassis and Suspension On both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down 43 mm telescopic forks. In contrast to the previous models, the rebound, compression and spring preload are all adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements, operating conditions, and load conditions. Suspension travel is 5.3 inches (F 900 R) and 6.7 inches (F 900 XR). The new F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminum wheels from the S 1000 R model, which weigh around 3.9 lbs. less. The reduced rotational mass is reflected in improved acceleration, braking and handling. The wheel dimensions are 3.5 x 17″ front and 5.5 x 17″ rear with 120/70 ZR 17 and 180/55 ZR 17 tires. Another new standard feature on the F 900 R and F 900 XR is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers more safety when braking in corners by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles. ABS Pro prevents the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied quickly and reduces abrupt changes in steering force and thus the bike from returning to the upright position, even during sudden braking. The benefits are increased braking and riding stability combined with the best possible deceleration even when cornering. ABS Pro is designed for road use, with medium to low friction values and optimum braking stability in the Rain and Road riding modes. Regulation takes place at an early stage. In Dynamic mode, ABS Pro assumes that the road surface has very high grip and has a high coefficient of friction. Accordingly, ABS Pro is designed for optimum deceleration, control is late and rear wheel lift detection is reduced. Another new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration. As soon as the sensor cluster supplies a certain deceleration value during braking, any simultaneous desire to accelerate on the part of the rider is detected as implausible and throttle valve opening is suppressed. This keeps the motorcycle stable and shortens the braking distance. Electronics The two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 1.7 lbs. lighter. The new F 900 R and F 900 XR also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights. In keeping with the “all in one” concept, the short, lightweight number plate holder and the rear turn indicator and number plate lights form a single unit, while the brake and taillight functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights. The new F 900 XR features Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight as standard. Other new standard features include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and heated grips. The adaptive headlight, part of Headlight Pro, offers more safety when riding at night. This adds additional LED modules which allow for better illumination of the road in bends, ensuring a safer night-time ride. The adaptive headlight, which is unique in these two motorcycle classes, works by activating these additional LED elements in the main headlights, which are equipped with their own reflectors, depending on the lean angle. The adaptive headlight turns on when the motorcycle leans by more than 10 degrees and is travelling at a speed of more than 6 mph. The additional lighting effect functions optimally up to a lean angle of approx. 25°. The F 900 XR has distinctive LED light guides to the left and right of the lower headlamp edge, indicating that it is part of the BMW Motorrad XR family. Ergonomics and Design. “We have made the riding position on the new F 900 R even more sporty and dynamic with an optimized ergonomic triangle. The new F 900 XR benefits from optimized front fairing aerodynamics, which is reflected in a significant reduction in helmet shake.” Dominik Menzel, Product Manager The handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. The handlebars are positioned further forwards than on the previous model. A sportier, front-leaning riding position has been achieved by moving the footrests further back and optimizing the foot control positions. The new F 900 XR offers more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimized aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet buffeting and even greater riding comfort. The hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather. The new F 900 XR can also be fitted with a new, optional 1.18-inch higher windscreen. Standard and Optional Equipment Like all 2025 model year BMW motorcycle models, the new F 900 R and F 900 XR include the Ultimate Care Break-In Service, or “600 Mile Service” as standard. This included service further provides BMW customers with a truly premium experience. Time and mileage limits apply – maximum 6 months from the in-service date or maximum 750 miles – whichever comes first.",,rss,"The article primarily covers the introduction of the 2025 BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR motorcycles, detailing the new features, technical specifications, and upgrades these models have received.

How Utah's electric vehicle charging prices compare to the rest of the US,"Utah's gas prices are a slightly higher than the national average, but new data shows it has some of the lowest electric vehicle recharging prices.",https://www.ksl.com/article/51195478/how-utahs-electric-vehicle-charging-prices-compare-to-the-rest-of-the-us,,2024-11-22 13:36:00,KSL,,"Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes SALT LAKE CITY — At $3.11 per gallon, Utah's average cost for regular gasoline is one of the more expensive in the U.S. a week before Thanksgiving, about a nickel higher than the national average, according to AAA. However, with an average of about $0.29 per kilowatt-hour, the organization says the Beehive State is home to some of the cheapest electric vehicle prices in the nation right now. AAA announced Thursday that it will now track electric vehicle charging costs as part of its fuel price index in response to a growing demand in the market. ""With nearly 2 million members living in households with one or more electric vehicles, AAA recognizes the need to track the average kilowatt-per-hour cost for all levels of public charging by state,"" officials wrote in a statement. The national average debuted at about $0.35 per kilowatt-hour, making Utah's average roughly a nickel per kilowatt-hour lower than the average. Only Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and Texas have lower rates in the inaugural report, while Hawaii, West Virginia, Montana, New Hampshire and Arkansas have the highest rates — ranging from $0.42 to $0.57 per kilowatt-hour. The scattered nature is much different from the gasoline prices right now, where the cheapest prices are centered across the lower Midwest and most of the Southeast. The highest gasoline prices are centered across the West and Northeast right now. Additional data shows which states have the most public electric vehicle charging stations. Utah's average is based on a review of the costs at 544 public charging stations scattered across the state, which makes it 21st in terms of available charging stations for anyone to access. There were a little over 37,000 electric vehicles and 76,000 hybrid vehicles registered in Utah this year, according to the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles. The number of electric vehicles alone is nearly seven times higher than what the agency reported five years ago. Meanwhile, the number of public charging stations in U.S. states is fairly close to the country's population leaders, as one would suspect. However, it also indicates which states have jumped onto the electric vehicle trend faster than others. California leads the nation with over 11,300 stations, nearly double any other state. New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas round out the top five. Wyoming and North Dakota are the only states with fewer than 20 public stations, at least at the time of the first report. Alaska, Montana and Louisana round out the bottom five in access. Of course, many more are on the way in Utah and across the West. Charge West, a project aiming to add stretches of electric vehicle charging stations across rural highways across Utah, as well as Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming, picked up last month.

Nach rund 20 Millionen gebauten Exemplaren stellte Ford die beliebte Baureihe Fiesta ohne direkten Nachfolger ein. Der Grund: die Neuausrichtung der Markenstrategie. Auch wenn es damit keine neuen Fiesta mehr gibt, als junge Gebrauchte sind die kompakten Ford-Modelle sehr gefragt und dennoch günstig zu haben. Insgesamt finden sich auf dem AUTO BILD-Gebrauchtwagenmarkt über 4800 Exemplare der Fiesta-Baureihe. Von der achten und letzten Generation, die ab 2017 zum Verkauf stand, werden aktuell rund 2800 Modelle angeboten. Bei so einer großen Auswahl dürfen Interessenten ruhig etwas wählerisch sein. Wer beispielsweise einen maximal vier Jahre alten Fiesta mit bis zu 10.000 Kilometer auf der Uhr sucht, kann immer noch aus fast 500 Angeboten wählen. Von sparsam bis sportlich Bei diesem Angebot ist klar, dass wirklich jeder Schnäppchenjäger seinen Traum-Fiesta finden kann. Schließlich gibt es auch in Sachen Motorisierung und Ausstattung nahezu freie Auswahl. Mit einer kleinen Ausnahme. Denn vom Diesel 1 .5 TDCi, der von 2017 bis 2020 verkauft wurde, sind auf dem Gebrauchtwarenmarkt derzeit nur fünf Modelle zu finden.

Think electric cars are causing UK’s potholes? Here’s what’s really happening,"Blaming EVs for the poor state of the nation’s roads is a ‘myth that desperately needs busting’, say motoring experts",https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/motoring/electric-cars-uk-potholes-what-happening-3390461,,2024-11-22 06:34:00,i,,"Explained Electric car advocates have been forced to fight a series of myths and misconceptions pushed by critics of the technology over the past decade. Despite their rise in popularity, one of the most persistent claims about electric vehicles (EVs) is that they are responsible for Britain’s pothole crisis. Several press stories and columns have suggested that because electric cars are typically heavier than petrol-based equivalents due to their batteries, they must be causing more damage to the roads. But motoring groups and experts told i that the idea is “stupid and ridiculous” – a flawed assumption based on a failure to understand the real causes behind the pothole epidemic. The AA said the belief that electric cars was behind the dire state of the nation’s roads was a “myth that desperately needs busting”. Quentin Wilson, the former Top Gear presenter, is frustrated that the potholes claim is still being circulated online among those sceptical about the rise of EVs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves promised an extra £500m for road repairs at last month’s Budget (Photo: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) “It’s a myth that has had real traction, sadly, when it’s demonstrably not true,” said the broadcaster, founder of the FairCharge campaign to make EVs more accessible. He points to a 2022 University of Edinburgh study, which he claims shows that the extra damage would be “overwhelmingly caused by large vehicles – buses, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs)” if batteries replaced fossil fuels. Passenger vehicles of all kinds make only a “negligible contribution”, according to the study. Wilson said: “It shows that damage to roads by passenger cars is miniscule compared to the damage by tankers, bin lorries and so on.” He added: “We have 1.2 million electric cars on our roads, compared to 41 million combustion engine vehicles. So how could electric cars cause the pothole crisis we have? EVs are a distraction from talking about how we fix the problem.” Robert Llewellyn, presenter of the Fully Charged YouTube channel on EVs, said blaming electric cars was “ridiculous”. The broadcaster added: “All vehicles enhance potholes in some way, and the HGVs will contribute most. But it’s as stupid blaming electric cars as blaming SUVs or any particular kind of car – it’s a bias based on nothing.” The Brussels-based sustainable transport group, Transport and Environment, says electric cars are 300kg to 400kg heavier than petrol and diesel equivalents on average. However, an October study by the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), which looked at the top ten best-selling electric and fossil-fuelled cars in Australia, found that the battery-powered vehicles were only 68kg heavier. Llewellyn said manufacturers were finding ways to shed weight from EVs. “Yes, electric cars have been generally heavier, but only by the weight of a person. And it won’t be true for much longer. Some electric cars are now lighter than their petrol equivalent.” Earlier this year the Daily Mail corrected an article which claimed that electric cars were helping push Britain’s crumbling roads to breaking point. It had suggested that a report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) had pointed the finger at EVs and their heavy, lithium-ion batteries. In fact, the AIA’s March 2024 report had only referred to “increased average vehicle weights on a deteriorating network”, without specifying any particular kind of vehicle. The real thrust of report had been about the lack of funding to repair potholes and upgrade roads – blaming lack of Government investment for the “continued deterioration”. Chancellor Rachel Reeves promised an extra £500m for road repairs at last month’s Budget. But AIA’s 2024 report found that many years of cuts to council budgets meant the amount needed to fix the backlog of road repairs in England and Wales has risen to a record high of £16.3bn. The RAC estimates that there are now more than one million potholes in the UK. The motoring group’s head of policy, Simon Williams, said that blaming EVs was “a distraction” from “the lack of preventive maintenance on our roads for too long”. The RAC expert added: “It lies with Government to provide more funding, but we’ve really need to encourage councils to carry our more maintenance with the money they’ve got.” Jack Cousens, heads of roads policy at AA, said it was “unfair and misleading” to blame potholes on EVs. “It’s a myth that desperately needs busting. “The reality is it’s the big stuff – the buses, lorries, HGVs, refuse trucks – that causes the imperfections in the tarmac. And when you get water in and it freezes, you get the expanding and contracting, and that’s what creates potholes.” Cousens laid the blame at both local and central government. He said most councils were carrying out “patch and run” work which see some potholes filled, rather than focus on comprehensive resurfacing of local road networks. “The reason for the plethora of potholes is that we haven’t maintained our road network brilliantly. It’s not been a political priority.” He added: “They are an annoyance to drivers. And they can be fatal for those on two wheels. We’ve seen coroner reports where they write to local authorities and say, ‘Your lack of pothole maintenance regime has contributed to that fatality’.” Llewellyn said he gets jealous whenever he travels to mainland Europe, saying many countries there have “incredibly smooth” roads. “There are bits of the Cotswolds where I live that are catastrophically bad. It’s been a lack of money over a long time.” However, not everyone entirely dismisses the impact of EVs. Britpave – the British Cementitious Paving Association – has warned that heavier electric cars could exacerbate the problem of poorly-maintained roads. Chairman Joe Quirke has said the nation’s roads need to be made “strong enough to withstand the additional weight of electric cars”. EV critics also point to other practical problems. Charging infrastructure is not expanding quickly enough, they argue, leaving some to queue for hours or face potential breakdowns if nearby chargers are out of action. Llewellyn said many of the most frustrating claims about EVs – they cannot travel far enough, or are far more expensive than petrol cars – once had a grain of truth, but are now completely outdated. But the pothole myth? It is simply a “stupid, pig ignorant idea” that must finally be put to bed, said the presenter. The Government was approached for comment.",UK,bing,"The article effectively challenges a popular myth about electric vehicles and their alleged contribution to the UK's pothole problem.

Pension funds warn watering down electric car targets could risk investments,Pension fund managers have warned that “chopping and changing” electric vehicle (EV) sales targets could risk investment in the UK.,https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/pensions-and-retirement/pension-funds-ev-targets-risk-investments-3390385,,2024-11-22 06:07:00,i,,"Pension fund managers have warned that “chopping and changing” electric vehicle (EV) sales targets could risk investment in the UK. There are fears that ministers could relax rules on the UK’s EV market following claims that the high sales quotas have pushed carmakers to crisis point. This would “damage investment confidence”, fund managers have told i . It comes after carmakers met the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, this week and argued that urgent action is needed to change the current system. As of 2024, carmakers must ensure that 22 per cent of car sales and 10 per cent of van sales in the UK are EVs, or they will incur a £15,000 penalty for each vehicle outside the target. However, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) predicts EV sales will only reach 18.5 per cent of the total market. Carmakers are asking the Government to adjust these quotas to relieve the pressure on the industry, although so far this has been rejected by Labour. There are warnings this could affect UK investment confidence. Giants including Phoenix Group, M&G, Aviva, and Schroders have all poured money into charging points in recent years on the basis that the mandate would help to encourage the take-up of EVs. Laura Hillis, director of climate and environment at Church of England Pensions Board, warned about making any changes. Speaking to i , she said: “Long-term investors like pension funds want to see robust, ambitious plans and policies for the transport sector in the UK. “This includes building out needed infrastructure and sending clear and consistent policy signals to the market. “Chopping and changing policy on electric vehicles would be a mistake and would damage investment confidence.” A policy change would threaten future investments across a range of green technologies, from wind and solar farms to carbon capture, sources said. Many are based on separate commitments from Sir Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, on these green technologies. Currently, the ZEV mandate will require 28 per cent of carmakers’ sales to be electric in 2025 and then gradually to 80 per cent by 2030. Bruno Gardner, head of climate and nature at Phoenix Group, said: “As an institutional investor, Phoenix Group places a high value on long-term policy and regulatory stability. “The EV mandate sets a good example for building confidence in transition investment.” Phoenix Group is calling on the Government to “build even more confidence by developing an economy-wide national transition plan with sector-specific roadmaps and capital raising plans,” he added. Adam Gillett, senior investment manager at Railpen, said: “The message to policymakers is clear: implementing the ZEV mandate effectively would stimulate investment across the zero-emissions vehicle supply chain, drive down costs and grow demand. “We need stable policy, and for market participants to work together and engage positively in this transition.” Carmakers argue that the sales targets are too high and do not reflect the true level of demand among drivers. On Monday, Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, met Nissan representatives amid warnings that the targets must be changed to reflect “reality”. Nissan bosses reportedly told Haigh that the EV mandate is endangering jobs at its sprawling works in Sunderland. Labour has emphasised repeatedly it would bring certainty to the economy, claiming it would not flip-flop on policy in the way that critics said the previous Conservative administration did. Last week, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves told business leaders at the Mansion House dinner: “By drawing a line under instability business can now plan for the future.” However, one EV industry who spoke to ministers on Monday, told the Telegraph: “There is a real risk this frightens the horses. It is being seen as a sign that as soon as things get hard, ministers will just backtrack.”",Uncategorized,bing,"The article addresses significant concerns around electric vehicle (EV) sales targets in the UK and their impact on investment confidence, particularly from pension funds.

So schneiden Elektroautos beim TÜV-Report 2025 ab!,"Der neue TÜV-Report wertet auch zehn Elektroauto-Modelle aus. Besonders schlecht schnitt der Tesla Model 3 ab. Besonders gut ein E-Auto, das nicht mehr gebaut wird: der VW e-Golf. Was sind die größten Schwachstellen der E-Autos?",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/elektroautos-im-test-beim-tuev-tesla-model-3-renault-zoe-vw-e-golf-21173001.html,,2024-11-22 06:05:00,Roland Wildberg,,"Elektroautos erobern zunehmend auch den zweiten Auto-Markt, also die Gebrauchtwagen-Welt: Nachdem im vergangenen Jahr die ersten drei Modelle regulär als Typgruppen beim TÜV aufgenommen wurden, stellt der TÜV-Report 2025 nun schon zehn Typen vor. Das heißt, dass nun ausreichend große Mengen im Fahrzeugbestand sind, um in die HU-Statistik (Überblick: Die Gewinner und Verlierer beim TÜV ) aufgenommen zu werden. Wer ein gebrauchtes E-Auto sucht, kann sich hier über die Qualität der häufigsten Modelle informieren. Was sind die Schwachstellen vom Tesla Model 3? Auweia: Kein anderes Modell (ob nun mit Elektro- oder Verbrennungsmotor) hat schon in den ersten beiden Hauptuntersuchungen seines jungen Auto-Lebens so eine hohe Mängel-Quote wie die Fließheck-Limo Model 3. Allerdings sind die Laufleistungen auch sehr hoch. Doch die starke Abnutzung entschuldigt nicht die bereits ab Werk vorhandenen Schwachpunkte. Und bei knapp 40 Vertragswerkstätten in Deutschland – VW hat rund tausend Vertriebspartner – ist die regelmäßige Wartung ohnehin kein Kinderspiel. 14,2 Prozent aller TÜV-fälligen Tesla Model 3 rasselten durch die HU – also fast jeder siebte! Damit hat sich die Quote gegenüber 2024 um 0,5 Prozent nur marginal verbessert. Zoom Der Tesla Model 3 ist Mängel-König in der Klasse der zwei- bis dreijährigen HU-Kandidaten. Bild: Olaf Itrich / AUTO BILD Die kompakte Fließheck-Limousine, mit der Tesla vor sechs Jahren in den Massenmarkt einstieg, leidet unter einem verbreiteten Elektroauto-Problem : Chassis und Bremsen können dem hohen Gewicht, das vor allem durch die Akkus verursacht wird, zu wenig entgegensetzen. 15-mal häufiger als in dieser Altersgruppe allgemein üblich ist die Achsaufhängung mängelbehaftet. Bei der Bremse ist es umgekehrt: Da Elektroautos viel rekuperieren, wird die mechanische Bremse zu selten benutzt, das führt zu Rost auf den Scheiben – die dann getauscht werden müssen. Am Licht monierten TÜV-Prüfer dreimal häufiger Defekte als durchschnittlich üblich. Zoom Elektroautos bremsen überwiegend per Rekuperation, dadurch werden die mechanischen Bremsen selten beansprucht und neigen zum Rosten (Symbolfoto). Bild: Ralf Timm Die restlichen Baugruppen, zum Beispiel Lenkung, Federn und Dämpfer, sind hingegen unauffällig. Doch gerade frühe Tesla Model 3 sind oft nur mäßig verarbeitet, auch die Lackqualität ist dürftig. Warum haben E-Autos spezielle Problemzonen? Mit den Problemzonen Bremsen und Chassis ist Tesla allerdings nicht allein: So gut wie alle Elektroauto-Modelle haben hier Schwachstellen. Die Ursachen liegen in den Besonderheiten der Konstruktion: E-Autos sind aufgrund der Traktionsbatterie besonders schwer. So wiegt die größte Batterie des VW ID.3 mit 82 kWh bereits 514 Kilogramm (Tesla gibt das Batteriegewicht nicht bekannt). Solche hohen Gewichte belasten natürlich das Fahrwerk, hohe Fahrleistungen kommen hinzu. Die Bremsen ihrerseits leiden vor allem an Untätigkeit: Elektroautos verzögern überwiegend mit der Rekuperationsbremse. Das führt bei Tesla Model 3 und anderen E-Autos dazu, dass die Bremsscheiben rosten. Verrostete Bremsscheiben müssen ersetzt werden. Das führt zu teuren und aufwendigen Instandhaltungsarbeiten. Was sind die Schwachstellen vom Renault Zoe? Wie sich die Bilder gleichen: Auch der E-Kleinwagen Renault Zoe , einst meistverkauftes Elektroauto in Europa, hat Probleme mit der mechanischen Bremse – wenn auch nicht in so hohem Maße wie der Tesla. Doppelt so viele Mängel wie im Gesamtdurchschnitt zählt der TÜV bei diesem Typ. Zumeist sind die Scheiben verrostet. Tipp für E-Auto-Fahrer: Gelegentlich auf freier Strecke (!) stark bremsen, um die Scheiben von Flugrost zu reinigen. Zoom Deutschlands E-Auto-Liebling Renault Zoe hat ebenso wie der Tesla Model 3 Probleme mit Bremse und Fahrwerk. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Auch bei dem französischen Elektro-Kleinwagen sind die Akkus zu schwer für die Basis: Schon die mittelgroße 23-kWh-Batterie bringt 462 Kilogramm auf die Waage. Und offenbar haben auch die Konstrukteure bei Renault diese Belastung zu gering eingeschätzt, sodass die Achsaufhängung zehnmal häufiger beanstandet wird als der TÜV-Gesamtdurchschnitt bei Autos dieser Altersgruppen. Querlenkerlager, Spur- und Koppelstangen geben frühzeitig auf. Gute Nachricht: Auf Lenkanlage und Lenkgelenke schlägt das offenbar nur gering durch. Insgesamt beträgt die Mängelquote 8,9 Prozent, also fällt fast jeder zehnte Zoe durch die HU. Das ist für einen jungen Gebrauchtwagen viel zu viel. Warum ist der E-Golf so gut? Ausnahmen bestätigen die Regel: Auch im neuen TÜV-Report schneidet der E-Golf bemerkenswert gut ab. Die E-Variante des Golf 7, die Volkswagen sechs Jahre hindurch (2014 bis 2020) immerhin gut 145.500-mal baute, ist mit einer Mängelquote von 3,4 Prozent tatsächlich noch besser als das Verbrenner-Vorbild! Warum ist er so viel besser als andere Elektroautos? Zoom VW baute den e-Golf von 2014 bis 2020. Erst hatte er 115 PS, ab 2017 dann 136 PS. Bild: Toni Bader / AUTO BILD Ein Grund ist der kleine Akku: Er wiegt lediglich 318 Kilogramm. Dafür müssen sich e-Golf-Fahrer auch mit einer geringen Reichweite von (je nach Motorleistung) maximal 231 km nach WLTP-Norm zufriedengeben. Diese Bescheidenheit wird durch hohe Solidität belohnt. Weder Achsaufhängung noch Lenkanlage oder Antriebswellen sind auffällig. Lediglich die Funktion der Fußbremse wird vom TÜV häufiger bemängelt als im Gesamtschnitt. Bemerkenswert: Auch die zweite HU (nach vier oder fünf Jahren) absolviert der e-Golf mit Bravour: Die Mängelquote liegt bei 4,6 Prozent, das ist fast doppelt so gut wie der Jahrgangs-Gesamtschnitt. Wie sind die Qualitäten des ID.3? Ein bisschen bizarr: Obwohl der ID.3 bewusst als Elektroauto konstruiert wurde (und die einschlägigen Schwachpunkte also nicht existieren sollten), ist seine Mängelquote etwas höher als die vom e-Golf. Das mag zum Teil an den vielen Carsharing-Exemplaren liegen, die in den ersten Jahren über ""We Share"" und andere Dienste auf die Straße kamen und von ihren Mietern erfahrungsgemäß rücksichtslos getreten wurden. Letztendlich spielt das aber keine Rolle, denn auch der ID.3 hat eine erfreulich geringe Mängelquote: Nur 5 Prozent der TÜV-Kandidaten fielen durch die Prüfung. Allerdings haben ID.3 auch vergleichsweise niedrige Laufleistungen. Zoom Der VW ID.3 hat, anders als viele populäre E-Auto-Modelle, keine schwächliche Achsaufhängung. Bild: Volkswagen AG Auffällig sind – wie bei Elektroautos schon fast üblich – die Bremsscheiben an der Vorderachse, die zu wenig genutzt werden und daher rosten. Ein Lichtblick: Da VW an der Hinterachse in weiser Voraussicht Trommelbremsen montiert, die weit weniger rostanfällig sind, ist die Erneuerung von zwei Scheiben nur halb so teuer wie bei anderen Modellen. Die Achsaufhängung des ID.3 kommt mit dem hohen Fahrzeuggewicht gut zurecht, ihre Mängelquote liegt hier im allgemeinen Durchschnitt. Weitere E-Autos aus dem TÜV-Report 2025 gibt's in der Bildergalerie: Bildergalerie Kamera Elektroautos im TÜV-Report 2025 10 Bilder Was kann man gegen rostende Bremsen bei E-Autos tun? Bisher haben die Hersteller gegen das Problem, dass bei Elektroautos die Bremsen zu wenig genutzt werden und anfangen zu rosten, keine Lösung. Vereinzelt werden an der Hinterachse Trommelbremsen verbaut. Deren Bremswirkung ist zwar etwas geringer, doch sind sie verkapselt und daher gegen Rost durch geringe Nutzung gepaart mit feuchter Witterung besser geschützt. Der TÜV rät dazu, regelmäßig kräftig zu bremsen. Um damit weder nachfolgenden Verkehr noch sich selbst in Gefahr zu bringen, sollte man das nur auf leeren Straßen tun, wenn niemand direkt hinterherfährt. Außerdem muss dazu der Getriebewählhebel auf ""N"" gestellt werden, damit der Wagen nicht automatisch rekuperiert, was die Reinigungswirkung stark herabsetzen würde. So schnitten BMW i3 und Tesla Model S beim TÜV-Report 2023 ab 2023 nahm der TÜV erstmals eine vorläufige Auswertung bei bestimmten Elektroautos vor. Unter die Lupe genommen wurden unter anderem der BMW i3 und der Tesla Model S BMW i3: glatter Durchschnitt in der TÜV-Bilanz Auf Rang zwei der ausgewerteten E-Autos fuhr 2023 der BMW i3 . Mit einer 4,7-prozentigen Durchfallquote traf er genau den Mängelschnitt. Der i3 fiel durch defekte Abblendlichter und defekte Bremsscheiben negativ auf. Tesla Model S: nicht nur bei den E-Autos weit hinten Am schlechtesten schnitt im Vierer-E-Vergleich der Tesla Model S ab. Auch hier spielt das Scheinwerfer-Thema wieder eine Rolle. Neben Mängeln am Nebellicht und Abblendlicht machen beim Models S aber vor allem die Querlenker Probleme und sorgen für eine riesige Durchfallquote: 10,7 Prozent! Der Tesla landete damit im 128-Verbrenner-Ranking nicht nur im letzten Drittel, sondern auch auf dem drittletzten Platz. Schlechter schnitten 2023 nur noch der Dacia Duster und Dacia Logan ab.",,rss,"The article offers a comprehensive analysis of how various electric vehicle models performed in the 2025 TÜV report, providing critical insights into their strengths and weaknesses based on mechanical performance and quality of parts.

Für die musikalische Untermalung bei handwerklichen Tätigkeiten, ob draußen oder drinnen, sind Baustellenradios ideale Begleiter. Mit ihrem staub- und wassergeschützten Gehäuse widerstehen sie Regenschauern und leichten Stürzen problemlos. In unserem Test haben wir Radios untersucht, die sowohl UKW als auch DAB+ empfangen können und sowohl von renommierten Werkzeugherstellern wie Makita als auch von Radiospezialisten wie TechniSat stammen. Testsieger des AUTO BILD Baustellenradio-Test (2024): TechniSat Digitradio 231 OD Test-Empfehlung 2,0 gut TechniSat DigitRadio 231 OD 2,0 gut Sicher vor Spritzwasser (IPX4) Anschluss für Maschinenakkus Schickes Farb-Display Stimmen verhangen Display spiegelt Höhen etwas spitz Zum Angebot Das neue DigitRadio 231 OD bringt Musikgenuss in die Werkstatt! Dieses elegante Radio setzt nicht nur auf ein dezentes Design im Vergleich zu seinem Vorgänger, sondern überzeugt auch durch ein gut ablesbares Farb-Display, das die Bedienung erleichtert. Mit einem eingebauten Akku kann es auch fernab von Steckdosen oder bei abgeschaltetem Strom betrieben werden. Für längere Einsätze können sogar Maschinenakkus von Bosch Professional, Makita und DeWalt zur Stromversorgung dienen. Andere Geräte kann das Radio wiederum nicht selbst per USB aufladen, aber das ist zu verschmerzen. Mit einem Preis von knapp 150 Euro (Stand: Dezember 2023) bietet es einen ordentlichen Klang mit angenehmen Bässen. Die Stimmwiedergabe könnte klarer sein, jedoch sind Gesang und Sprachbeiträge gut verständlich. Test-Empfehlung 3,3 befriedigend Ueme DB 326 3,3 befriedigend Netz- und Batteriebetrieb Bluetooth Weckfunktion Keine Bässe Keine IP-Schutzklasse Umständliche Bedienung Zum Angebot Wenn Sie auf der Amazon-Website nach ""Baustellenradios"" suchen, erscheint unter anderem das Ueme DB-326 in den Ergebnissen und lockt mit einem attraktiven Preis von knapp 70 Euro (Stand: Dezember 2023). Dieses preisgünstige Modell bietet ebenfalls Bluetooth, DAB+ und einen Stereo-Eingang. Allerdings fehlen sowohl auf der Händlerseite als auch auf der Homepage konkrete Informationen zur Widerstandsfähigkeit bei Spritzwasser und Staub. Auch eine IP-Schutzstufe ist nicht angegeben. Handwerker sollten daher vorsichtig sein, in welchem Maße sie das Ueme Staub und Wasser aussetzen. Klanglich ist es in Ordnung, eignet sich jedoch nur für gelegentliches Hören: Es fehlt an Bässen, Stimmen klingen nasal, und die Mitten sind verwaschen – die Höhen sind passabel. Ein positiver Aspekt: Als einziges Gerät im Test kann es neben dem Netzbetrieb auch mit vier AA-Batterien oder entsprechenden Standardakkus betrieben werden. Im Fokus unseres Baustellenradiotests steht in erster Linie der Klang, der einen entscheidenden Beitrag zur Gesamtbewertung leistet – mehr als ein Drittel, um genau zu sein. Unsere Experten hören ganz präzise hin und analysieren das harmonische Zusammenspiel von Höhen, Mitten und Tiefen. Dabei wird nicht nur die Klangqualität im Allgemeinen bewertet, sondern auch die Deutlichkeit von Sprachbeiträgen intensiv geprüft. Analog zum kernigen Motorgeräusch vieler Autos legen wir Wert auf eine klare und unverfälschte Stimmwiedergabe. So garantieren wir, dass Ihr Baustellenradio nicht nur den richtigen Soundtrack für Ihre Werkstatt liefert, sondern auch in Sachen Klangqualität ganz vorne mitspielt. Allerdings liefern nicht alle Testkandidaten diesen. Zoom Welche zusätzlichen Funktionen bieten die Geräte noch? AUTO BILD hat die Baustellenradios im Test eingehend überprüft. Bild: Makita, AUTO BILD Außerdem haben wir die verschiedenen Empfangsarten, die von den Radios angeboten werden, geprüft. Dazu gehören in erster Linie DAB+ und UKW, während Internetradio bei Baustellenradios eher unüblich ist. Im Test überprüfen die Redakteure auch die vorhandenen Anschlüsse der Modelle. Gibt es beispielsweise einen Stereo-Eingang und eine USB-Ladebuchse? Hier gilt: Je umfangreicher die Ausstattung, desto besser die Bewertung. Zusätzliche Features wie ein Smartphone-Fach oder eine praktische Leuchte wirken sich positiv auf die Gesamtwertung aus. Der Testpunkt ""Bedienung"" fließt zu 20 Prozent in die Endnote ein. Dabei wird die Haptik der Knöpfe, die Struktur der Menüführung und die Lesbarkeit des Displays untersucht. Auch die Stromversorgung der Radios fällt unter diesen Punkt. Die Tester prüfen, ob und welche Modelle beispielsweise mit einem Akku betrieben werden können und welche zwingend auf ein Netzkabel angewiesen sind. Zoom Manche Baustellenradios verfügen über ein praktisches Fach für Smartphones, das für Schutz vor Staub und Feuchtigkeit sorgt. Doch nicht nur das: Über einen Aux-Anschluss können Sie Musik vom Smartphone auch direkt über das Radio abspielen lassen. Bild: Medion, AUTO BILD Doch auch weitere Kriterien beeinflussen die Qualität von Baustellenradios entscheidend und wurden von AUTO BILD getestet: Klangqualität: Der Klang ist von zentraler Bedeutung. Egal ob für Nachrichten oder Musik, das Gerät sollte klaren Sound bieten, ohne zu krächzen oder Stimmen zu verfälschen. Zudem ist eine gute Stereowiedergabe wünschenswert. Empfangswege: Ein erstklassiges Gerät ist sowohl mit UKW als auch mit DAB+ ausgestattet. Da die meisten Modelle keinen Internetzugang haben, spielt dieser Aspekt eine untergeordnete Rolle. Favoritenspeicher: Ein großzügiger Favoritenspeicher ist besonders für Musikliebhaber relevant, die häufig zwischen verschiedenen Programmen wechseln. Der Speicher sollte mindestens drei Plätze für Lieblingssender bieten. Anschlüsse: Grundsätzlich sollte ein Radio über eine Kopfhörerbuchse verfügen. Ein hochwertiges Gerät zeichnet sich durch Extras wie eine USB-Buchse zum Aufladen von Smartphones aus. Abspielquelle: Neben dem Radioempfang sollte das Gerät mindestens Bluetooth unterstützen oder einen Stereo-Eingang bieten. Dies ermöglicht beispielsweise die Kopplung mit dem Smartphone zur Wiedergabe von dort gespeicherten Titeln. Spitzenmodelle bieten zusätzlich Bluetooth-Funktionen. Bedienung: Ein schneller Senderwechsel und eine übersichtliche Menüführung sind entscheidend für ein gutes Radio. Das Display sollte Sendernamen deutlich und gut lesbar anzeigen. IP-Schutzzertifizierung: Kann das Gerät mit Farbspritzern oder sogar einem Regenschauer umgehen? Die IP-Zertifizierung gibt Auskunft darüber. Ein hochwertiges Baustellenradio sollte mindestens die Schutzstufe IPX4 aufweisen (Schutz vor allseitigem Spritzwasser). Wenn das Gerät einem Hochdruckreiniger standhalten soll, ist eine Gehäusezertifizierung von IPX6 (Schutz gegen starkes Strahlwasser) oder höher erforderlich. Zoom Das TechniSat DigitRadio 230 OD beeindruckte insbesondere durch seine umfassende Ausstattung, zu der unter anderem ein Stereo-Eingang (Aux) und eine USB-Ladebuchse gehören. Bild: TechniSat Das klangliche Schlusslicht, das Festool Sysrock, weist nahezu keine Bässe auf, während spitze Höhen für zischelnde S-Laute bei Gesang und Sprache sorgen. Die besten Klangeigenschaften für Schrauber bieten die Geräte von Makita und TechniSat, die sogar Stereoton bieten. Das TechniSat Digitradio 231 OD liegt am Ende leicht hinter dem Makita-Radio, da es bei den Bässen etwas zurückhaltender ist und die Höhen, insbesondere bei höherer Lautstärke, stark präsent sind. Im Test konnte sich das Makita DMR 115 mit einem kräftigeren Klang souverän gegen Arbeitsgeräusche durchsetzen, obwohl die Sprachverständlichkeit dabei etwas nachließ. In einem Schönheitswettbewerb würden Baustellenradios vielleicht nicht den ersten Platz belegen, aber sie punkten mit einem markanten Auftritt und deutlichen Zeichen von Robustheit. Das Makita DMR 115 und das TechniSat Digitradio 230 OD tragen die Schutzstufe IP65, was bedeutet, dass sie staubdicht (erste IP-Kennziffer: 6) sind und vor Strahlwasser aus verschiedenen Richtungen (zweite Ziffer: 5) geschützt werden. Das Metabo R12-18 ist gegen Staub und Spritzwasser geschützt (IP54), während das Festool nur vor Sprühwasser (IPX3) absichert. Das ""X"" im IP-Zertifikat weist darauf hin, dass keine Angabe zur Staubresistenz gemacht wurde. Beim Ueme 326, einem beliebten Modell auf Amazon, fehlt die IP-Zertifizierung vollständig. Obwohl es robust wirkt, sollten sich Nutzerinnen und Nutzer aufgrund fehlender Herstellerangaben nicht ausschließlich darauf verlassen. Informationen zur Stoßfestigkeit oder Fallhöhe, wie sie bei Action-Cams üblich sind, werden von den Herstellern der Radios nicht bereitgestellt. Dennoch sind sie mit schützend abstehenden Griffen und Gummi-Armierungen mindestens gegen Rempler geschützt. Zoom Die Bedienung des Ueme-Baustellenradios gestaltet sich klein und fummelig, keineswegs schrauberfreundlich. Bild: Ueme, AUTO BILD Verzwickte Menüstrukturen, umständliche Senderwechsel und das Fehlen von Favoritentasten machen die Baustellenradios wenig benutzerfreundlich. Wer gewohnt ist, herkömmliche Radios mit praktischen Drehreglern und gut angeordneten Tasten zu bedienen, muss sich als Heimwerker und Werkstattkönig bei der Handhabung der Testkandidaten umstellen. Einzig das TechniSat Digitradio 230 OD verfügt über Drehregler für die Lautstärke und Senderwahl, die sich auch mit Arbeitshandschuhen gut bedienen lassen. Obwohl es anstelle von speziellen Sender-Speichertasten nur eine Taste für die Favoritenübersicht hat, konnten im Test die zehn Favoritensender problemlos abgerufen werden. Makita kombiniert die Bedienung mit Drehreglern und Tasten. Der große Knopf in der Mitte der Front regelt die Lautstärke, während der Drehregler nach einem Druck auf die ""Advanced""-Taste zur Senderwahl dient. Die beleuchteten Tasten am Makita erleichtern die Bedienung bei Nacht. Die anderen Radios erschweren Heimwerkern die Handhabung, wobei die Bedienung des Metabo R12-18 im DAB-Modus besonders umständlich ist. Um den gewünschten Sender auszuwählen, muss man sich mühsam durch die lange Senderliste navigieren. Zudem lassen sich nur UKW-Sender als Favoriten speichern, nicht jedoch DAB-Radiostationen. Die kleinen Radios von Festool und Ueme teilen sich ähnliche Schwächen. Beide Geräte erfordern eher filigrane als grobe Hände aufgrund ihrer kleinen, dicht beieinanderliegenden Tasten. Hinsichtlich der Displays zeigen sich alle Radios wenig ambitioniert: einfarbige Anzeigen ohne optische Raffinesse. Sendernamen und Musiktitel werden leidlich dargestellt, weitere Informationen von DAB-Sendern, wie zum Wetter, fehlen. Das Makita-Display ist am besten ablesbar, auch wenn eine größere Ausführung wünschenswert wäre. Das üppigere Display hätte auch dem Ueme DB 326 gutgetan, jedoch stört hier noch mehr, dass es in der Oberseite des Radios eingebaut ist. Dadurch müssen Nutzer von oben auf das Gerät schauen. Im Vergleich dazu ist das schräg angebrachte Display des Metabo klar besser positioniert. Zoom Praktisch: Das Makita DMR 112 kann mit verschiedenen Werkzeugakkus betrieben werden. Bild: Makita Mit Ausnahme des Ueme können die Baustellenradios nicht nur an der Steckdose, sondern auch mit Akkus betrieben werden. Positiv: Der TechniSat wird mit einem austauschbaren Akku geliefert. Die Radios von Metabo, Makita, TechniSat und Festool können mit den Werkzeugakkus der jeweiligen Hersteller betrieben werden. Die Kompatibilität der Akkupacks ist in der Bedienungsanleitung der Radios aufgeführt. Ein Nachteil besteht darin, dass die Werkzeugakkus nicht in den Radios aufgeladen werden können; dies ist nur in den separaten Ladegeräten der Hersteller möglich. In Bezug auf ihre Ausstattung entsprechen die Testkandidaten dem Niveau herkömmlicher Mittelklasseradios. Alle verfügen über Bluetooth, sodass Benutzer ihr Smartphone drahtlos mit dem Radio verbinden und ihre Lieblingsmusik abspielen können. Mit Ausnahme von Metabo bieten alle Baustellenradios einen Stereo-Eingang (3,5-Millimeter-Klinke), an den ein Mobiltelefon per Kabel angeschlossen werden kann. Wenn gleichzeitig das Handy aufgeladen werden soll, sind das Makita, TechniSat oder Festool die geeigneten Modelle. Diese drei Radios verfügen über eine USB-Ladebuchse. Testsieger ist kein Werkzeughersteller, sondern ein Radiohersteller: Das TechniSat Digitradio 231 OD überzeugt mit beeindruckendem Sound, umfassender Ausstattung und müheloser Bedienung. Den Preis-Leistungs-Sieg sichert sich das Ueme DB 326.

Was bedeuten die SF-Klassen S und M?,"Die Schadenfreiheitsklasse bestimmt die Höhe des Beitrags der Kfz-Versicherung. Die Klassen S und M sind Sondereinstufungen, die den Tarif richtig teuer machen können. Welche Fahrer dort eingestuft werden.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/sf-klassen-s-und-m-in-der-kfz-versicherung-16120083.html,,2024-11-22 05:00:00,Lena Trautermann,,"Wer lange Zeit unfallfrei fährt, wird von seiner Kfz-Versicherung mit niedrigeren Beiträgen belohnt: Das Stichwort dazu heißt Schadenfreiheitsrabatt . Je länger man unfallfrei fährt, desto mehr Rabatt gibt es auf den Versicherungsbeitrag. Die Zahl der unfallfreien Jahre bestimmt dabei die Schadenfreiheitsklasse. Es gibt allerdings auch Einstufungen für Sonderfälle, etwa die Klassen S und M. Gerade die Klasse M kann für den Fahrer besonders teuer werden. Alle Infos! Wie funktioniert das SF-Klassen-System? Die Schadenfreiheitsklasse gibt an, wie viele Jahre man unfallfrei gefahren ist bzw. wie viele schadenfreie Jahre die Versicherung anrechnet. Wer durch viele Jahre unfallfreien Fahrens in eine hohe SF-Klasse eingestuft wird, der bekommt einen entsprechend hohen Schadenfreiheitsrabatt auf den zu zahlenden Grundbeitrag angerechnet. Die Schadenfreiheitsklassen reichen von SF-Klasse 0 (Ersteinstufung für Fahranfänger mit weniger als drei Jahren Fahrerlaubnis ) bis SF-Klasse 35 (35 Jahre unfallfrei). Mit höherer SF-Klasse wird die Kfz-Versicherung also immer günstiger. Umgekehrt kann der Versicherte allerdings auch wieder zurückgestuft werden , wenn er der Versicherung einen selbstverschuldeten Schaden melden muss. Die Versicherung überprüft jeweils zum Jahresende, ob ein Schaden gemeldet wurde, und passt die Schadenfreiheitsklasse entsprechend an. Wann landet man in SF-Klasse S oder M? SF-Klasse M: Wer als Fahranfänger eine Kfz-Versicherung abschließt, der landet in der Regel in der SF-Klasse 0, sprich null unfallfreie Jahre. Da hier noch keine schadenfreien Jahre gesammelt wurden, gibt es theoretisch noch keinen Rabatt zu verlieren. Aber wer jetzt einen Unfall baut, wird trotzdem herabgestuft – und zwar in die Klasse M (für Malus). Sie ist nur durch Rückstufung erreichbar und geht in der Haftpflicht üblicherweise mit mindestens dem eineinhalbfachen Beitragssatz einher, in der Kasko können sogar weit über 200 Prozent des eigentlichen Beitrags fällig werden.

Reboarder: Warum diese Kindersitze besonders sicher sind,"Im Reboarder sitzen Kinder rückwärts im Auto, was ihnen bei einem Frontalaufprall mehr Schutz bietet – wir haben die Besten getestet.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/reboarder-test-21306263.html,,2024-11-22 05:00:00,AUTO BILD,,"Reboarder schaffen zusätzliche Sicherheit Dabei birgt die Sitz-Position des Kindes entgegen der Fahrtrichtung auch danach noch entscheidende Sicherheitsvorteile: Bei Babys und kleinen Kindern sind Hals- und Nackenmuskulatur nur schwach bis gar nicht entwickelt. Zudem ist der Kopf im Verhältnis zur Körpergröße sehr groß. Gerade Babys und Kleinkinder können dadurch den Belastungen eines Frontalaufpralls nicht standhalten. Deswegen ist der rückwärtsgerichtete Transport unabdingbar – und zwar auch noch im Kleinkind-Alter. Denn erst ab einem Alter von etwa vier Jahren hat sich das Verhältnis von Kopf- und Körpergröße normalisiert und die Muskulatur der Halswirbelsäule ist ausreichend ausgebildet, um einem Frontalcrash standhalten zu können. Bis zum Alter von vier Jahren passt das System Im Reboarder können die Kinder ungefähr bis zu einem Alter von vier Jahren transportiert werden. Es handelt sich dabei entweder um Folgesitze für die Babyschale oder Kindersitze, die bereits ab der Geburt genutzt werden können. Die meisten Reboarder sind bereits nach der neuen i-Size-Norm zugelassen. Die neue Norm wird die alte Gruppeneinteilung (ECE R 44) langfristig ersetzen. Hier entscheidet dann nicht mehr das Gewicht des Kindes über den geeigneten Kindersitz, sondern die Körpergröße, die vom Hersteller individuell für den jeweiligen Sitz bestimmt wird. Dementsprechend sind auch die Nutzungszeiträume der Reboarder unterschiedlich. Zusätzlich geben die Hersteller aber oft auch eine Gewichtsgrenze an. Der Reboarder GB Vaya ist zum Beispiel für eine Körpergröße zwischen 45 und 105 Zentimeter zugelassen. Gleichzeitig liegt das Maximalgewicht des Kindes bei 18 Kilo. Der Sitz kann also etwa bis zu einem Alter von vier Jahren genutzt werden. Eine Schwenkfunktion schafft Variabilität Bei Reboardern gibt es zudem unterschiedliche Funktionen: Viele von ihnen sind mittlerweile mit einer Schwenkfunktion ausgestattet. Diese ermöglicht ein besonders einfaches Einsetzen des Kindes, da sich der Sitz um 90 Grad drehen lässt. Der Sitz kann also zur Autotür gedreht und das Kind so gerade durch die Tür in den Sitz gesetzt werden. Beim Kauf eines Reboarders ist es ratsam auf diese Funktion zu achten, denn sie schont nicht nur die Nerven, sondern auch den Rücken der Eltern. Außerdem vermindert die Schwenkfunktion die Gefahren der Fehlbedienung, da das Kind im Sitz gut einsehbar ist und alle Gurte optimal eingestellt werden können. Einige Reboarder verfügen sogar um eine 360-Grad-Drehfunktion (z.B. Recaro Zero.1 Elite i-Size). Sie können sowohl rückwärts- als auch vorwärtsgerichtet genutzt werden. Für den Fall, dass sich Eltern die Möglichkeit des Transports in Fahrtrichtung offenhalten wollen. Trotzdem ist hier der rückwärtsgerichtete Transport bis zu einem Alter von 15 Monaten Pflicht. Die Befestigung erfolgt meist über Isofix Da die meisten Reboarder bereits nach der neuen Norm i-Size zugelassen sind, werden sie in der Regel über Isofix im Fahrzeug befestigt. Die drehbaren Reboarder stehen auf einer integrierten Basis, andere Modelle können in eine Basis eingerastet werden. Die Isofix-Arme werden an den Ankerpunkten des Fahrzeugs befestigt. Zusätzlich wird der Sitz gegen das Kippen bei einem Unfall gesichert: Dafür gibt es entweder einen zusätzlichen Stützfuß oder einen sogenannten Toptether-Gurt, der im dafür vorgesehenen Punkt auf der Rückseite des Fahrzeugsitzes eingehakt wird. Gerade die Reboarder, die auf einer (integrierten) Basis stehen, können ausschließlich mit dem Isofix-System befestigt werden. Deswegen sollte hier unbedingt vorab geklärt werden, ob es mit dem jeweiligen Auto möglich ist, den Kindersitz ordnungsgemäß zu installieren. Allerdings verfügen mittlerweile fast alle modernen Autos über den für i-Size nötigen Standard. Ansonsten gibt die Typenliste des jeweiligen Sitzes Aufschluss darüber. Es gibt aber auch Reboarder, die ganz klassisch mit dem Dreipunktgurt des Fahrzeugs gesichert werden können (z.B. Britax Römer Max-Way Plus). Für das Kind hat der Reboarder ein eigenes Gurtsystem. Dieses ist über die Kopfstütze verstellbar. Optimal sitzt es, wenn der Gurt direkt über der Schulter des Kindes aufliegt. Ist das Kind angeschnallt, sollte der Gurt so festgezurrt werden, dass noch bequem zwei Finger zwischen Gurt und Oberkörper des Kindes passen – dann ist er stramm genug. Polster an den Gurten verhindern ein Einschneiden im Hals- und Brustbereich des Kindes.

Im Hyundai ist es am luftigsten Obwohl sich die drei Teilnehmer in der Länge nur um ein paar Zentimeter und in der Breite nur um Millimeter unterscheiden, lassen sich beim Raumangebot doch klare Favoriten ausmachen. Vorn sitzen wir im Hyundai am luftigsten, genießen in allen Richtungen einen Hauch mehr Bewegungsfreiheit. Was ein bisschen überrascht, weil der Skoda sein Plus bei der Außenhöhe (rund 2 cm) nicht in mehr Kopffreiheit umsetzen kann und mit 54 Zentimetern auch bei der Sitzhöhe einen Zentimeter hinter dem i30 liegt. Zoom Gleiche Größe: Scala, Corolla und i30 haben fast identische Abmessungen, beim Platzangebot gibt es dennoch Unterschiede. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Die Polster konnten in keinem der drei Kompakten so richtig gefallen. Es fehlt entweder an Größe oder an Kontur oder an bequemer Polsterung, am liebsten haben wir im Scala Platz genommen – auch wenn die integrierten Kopfstützen für sehr große Piloten nicht optimal sind. Reihe zwei ist eng im Corolla Wer hinten einsteigt, wird im Corolla am wenigsten glücklich. Zwar finden auch im Japaner drei (schlanke) Gäste nebeneinander Platz, sie sollten aber nicht übermäßig groß sein – Kopf und Knie stoßen früher an ihre Grenzen als in Scala und i30. Zoom Nicht wirklich groß: Im Corolla stoßen wir hinten am ehesten mit Kopf und Knien an. Auch der Kofferraum ist klein für einen Kompakten. Bild: Christoph Börries /AUTO BILD Bei der Gepäckfrage muss sich der Corolla ebenfalls hinten anstellen. Maximal nur 1051 Liter (i30/Scala: 1301/1410 l) sind eher Kleinwagen-Niveau, auch die 750 Kilogramm (i30/Scala: 1210/1250 kg) Anhängelast helfen da nur bedingt weiter.

Der zentrale Monitor zeigt sich dabei erfreulich gut erreichbar, einige Elemente liegen aber zu tief (Klimaregler bei Hyundai und Skoda) oder sind schlecht platziert (Schaltergruppe links vom Lenkrad sowie zu viele Tasten auf dem Lenkrad in Hyundai und Toyota ). Die digitalen Instrumente des i30 sind in ihrer fast schon analogen Anmutung klar und übersichtlich gestaltet und gefallen. Eingeschränkte Sprachsteuerung im Scala Die Sprachsteuerung hinterlässt im Toyota den besten Eindruck. Über ""Hey, Toyota"" lassen sich zuverlässig Naviziele eingeben oder die Temperatur verstellen. Sinnvoller als das Öffnen des Fensters hätten wir aber eine Aktivierung der Sitzheizung empfunden. Im Skoda hören nur Navi und Audioanlage aufs Wort, das funktioniert aber recht problemlos. Der Hyundai kann per Stimme Navi , Klima, Audio und Sitzheizung befehligen, reagiert aber empfindlich auf Störgeräusche und verlangt vom Fahrer viel Gelassenheit. Zoom Im Skoda Scala lassen sich lediglich Navi und Audioanlage per Sprachbefehl steuern. Das funktioniert allerdings recht problemlos. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Ruhig bleiben heißt es auch, wenn für Apple CarPlay und Android Auto ein Kabel verlangt wird.

Der mildhybridisierte i30 muss jetzt mit 140 (vorher 160) PS auskommen, wirkt zwar gemütlich, aber nicht schläfrig. In 9,4 Sekunden geht es auf Tempo 100, fast 200 km/h Spitze sind drin, einzig der Siebengang-Doppelkuppler lässt sich schon mal zu viel Zeit. Erst obenraus wird es dann eher zäh und auch recht lautstark. Und mit 6,8 l/100 km zeigt sich der Hyundai auch am durstigsten. Zoom Drei unterschiedliche Charaktere: Der Scala ist der sportlichste, im Corolla geht es sehr gelassen voran, der i30 liegt dazwischen. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Deutlich weniger Temperament vermittelt der ebenfalls 140 PS starke Corolla. Der Vollhybrid mit stufenloser Automatik (die immer etwas zu hoch zu drehen scheint) kommt eher verhalten in die Gänge, braucht bis Tempo 160 tatsächlich 32,9 Sekunden und schafft maximal nur 180 km/h. Wer den Japaner hetzt, wird mit ihm kaum glücklich. Wer sich aber auf das zurückhaltende Wesen einlässt, fährt recht entspannt und vor allem günstig. 5,4 Liter sind der Bestwert hier und echt ein Wort. Mit 150 PS der Stärkste und mit flotten 8,1 Sekunden auf Tempo 100 sowie beeindruckenden 220 km/h Spitze macht der Scala auf Dynamiker. Dazu passen der aufmerksame Doppelkuppler und die ausgewogene Lenkung. Auch das Sportfahrwerk SCC spielt auf Sport gut mit, gibt den verbindlich-straffen Dynamiker, wirkt im Normalmodus an der Vorderachse aber leicht unterdämpft.

Tatsächlich ein unterschätztes Auto. Punktet immer noch mit der Korea-Tugend, viel Auto zum fairen Preis zu bieten. Angenehmer Typ. Schwächelt beim Platz, der sparsame Hybrid ist aber eine Empfehlung. Gelassener Begleiter. Sowohl Toyota als auch Hyundai fahren beim Fahrwerkskomfort dennoch leicht hinterher. Grundsätzlich bieten beide eine ordentliche Abstimmung, der Corolla poltert aber lautstark durch Schlaglöcher und Frostaufbrüche, während der i30 auf Flickenteppichen und welligem Profil zappelig wirkt. An der Kasse gewinnt der i30 Die beim Corolla serienmäßige Automatik sowie testrelevante Extras eingerechnet, liegen alle drei über 30.000, aber klar unter 40.000 Euro.

Nach einem Glühwein kann der Führerschein in Gefahr sein!,"Wer auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt einen Glühwein genießen möchte, sollte das Auto am besten stehen lassen. Sonst könnte der Führerschein schnell weg sein.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/gluehwein-trinken-als-autofahrer-experten-warnen--27692081.html,,2024-11-22 05:00:00,Andreas Reiners,,"Für viele Menschen gehört der Besuch auf dem Weihnachtsmarkt fest zur Vorweihnachtszeit. Viele gönnen sich dann auch gerne einen Glühwein, weil auch der dazugehört. Der TÜV Thüringen rät Autofahrern allerdings, konsequent auf Glühwein zu verzichten. Denn bereits nach dem ersten Glühwein kann der Führerschein in Gefahr sein! ""Je nach Rezeptur und Alkoholgehalt kann die Blutalkoholkonzentration bei einem 80 Kilogramm schweren Mann schon nach dem Genuss von einem Becher Glühwein über die kritische Grenze von 0,3 Promille ansteigen. Ab dieser Konzentration drohen bereits Strafen, wenn der Autofahrer beispielsweise in einen Unfall verwickelt wird oder durch eine unsichere Fahrweise auffällt"", erklärt Verkehrspsychologin Marie-Christin Perlich vom TÜV Thüringen. Keine Alkoholverflüchtigung Dass Glühwein durch das Erhitzen an Alkohol verliert und so das ein oder andere Glas mehr getrunken werden kann, ist eine falsche Annahme. Denn Alkohol verflüchtigt sich erst ab 78 Grad Celsius. Glühwein wird allerdings meistens mittels Durchlauferhitzern auf eine Temperatur um die 70 Grad erhitzt. Zur Alkoholverflüchtigung kommt es also nicht. Zoom Bei einer Kontrolle kann es ein böses Erwachen geben. Bild: Ralf Timm Der exakte Alkoholgehalt des hochprozentigen Getränks ist daher nur selten ersichtlich. Problematisch ist auch, dass laut der Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung der Körper warme Getränke besonders schnell aufnimmt. Dadurch gelangt der Alkohol aus dem Glühwein rascher ins Blut als bei kalten Getränken. Dieser Effekt wird zusätzlich durch den hohen Zuckergehalt des heißen Weins verstärkt, da der Zucker den Übergang des Alkohols in die Blutbahn beschleunigt. Die Empfehlung der Expertin: ""Generell sollte nach dem Genuss von Alkohol auf das Fahrzeug verzichtet werden – egal ob Auto, E-Scooter oder Fahrrad. Wer weiß, dass er fahren muss, sollte in der Adventszeit besser alkoholfreie Punschgetränke genießen."" Harte Strafen drohen Was droht bei Verstößen? Bereits ab einer Blutalkoholkonzentration von 0,5 Promille oder einem Atemalkoholwert von 0,25 mg /l drohen Ersttätern ein Monat Fahrverbot, eine Geldstrafe von 500 Euro und zwei Punkte im Fahreignungsregister. Wiederholungstäter zahlen deutlich mehr: 1000 Euro beim zweiten und 1500 Euro beim dritten Verstoß. Hinzu kommen drei Monate Fahrverbot und weiterhin zwei Punkte in Flensburg. Diese Grenzwerte können schon nach zwei Tassen Glühwein erreicht werden, und selbst eine kurze Alkoholabbauphase schützt nicht zwingend vor Überschreitung. Kommt es unter Alkoholeinfluss zu einer Straßenverkehrsgefährdung – meist ab 1,1 Promille – steigen die Strafen drastisch: Drei Punkte, der Entzug der Fahrerlaubnis und hohe Geldstrafen oder sogar Freiheitsstrafen sind die Folge.

Dieser Skoda Citigo hat den Supermarktparkplatz gegen die Rundstrecke getauscht. Klingt wie ein schlechter Scherz, ist aber nichts als die Wahrheit, denn an diesem Citigo ist praktisch nichts mehr so, wie es einmal war! Eigentlich steht der mit dem VW Up und dem Seat Mii baugleiche Skoda Citigo für günstige Basismobilität, doch dieser silberne Citigo kommt direkt aus der Hölle. Verantwortlich für den Komplettumbau ist ein britischer Tuner mit dem passenden Namen ""Darkside Performance"", der den einst schnöden Kleinstwagen in ein reinrassiges Tracktool verwandelt hat. Ein aufwendiger Prozess, bei dem keine Schraube unangetastet blieb. XXL-Ladeluftkühler und Porsche-Bremse Sogar dem ungeschulten Auge dürfte auf den ersten Blick auffallen, dass es sich hierbei um keinen Citigo von der Stange handelt. Neben den weißen 17-Zoll-Felgen vom großen Bruder Octavia , hinter denen eine Porsche-Bremsanlage mit roten Sätteln hervorlugt, verrät vor allem der XXL-Ladeluftkühler an der Front den Umbau. Details wie Schiebefenster, eine Abrisskante am Heck und das fast schon unauffällige Endrohr vor dem Hinterrad auf der Beifahrerseite entlarven ihn schlussendlich. Zoom Plastikfenster, eine große Abrisskante und die 17-Zoll-Felgen vom Octavia entlarven den Umbau.

Das Interieur ist bis aufs blanke Blech leer geräumt. Alles, was nicht zwingend benötigt wurde, flog raus. Stattdessen wurden ein FIA-zertifizierter Vollkäfig, Schalensitze mit Sechspunktgurten der Firma Schroth und ein geschüsseltes Lenkrad verbaut. Doch das ist noch immer nicht das eigentliche Highlight – das verbirgt sich unter der kleinen Motorhaube. Mit dem ab Werk maximal 75 PS starken Citigo hat dieser Anblick rein gar nichts mehr zu tun. Der niedliche Einliter-Dreizylinder hat ausgedient und wurde durch einen doppelt so großen Vierzylinder-Diesel (Motorcode CFHD) aus dem VAG-Konzern ersetzt.

Investors should learn about ...",https://www.benzinga.com/money/best-electric-vehicle-stocks,,2024-11-21 23:59:00,Benzinga.com,,"BYD Company Limited and its subsidiaries work in the sphere of research, development, manufacture and sale of automobiles and related products in the People’s Republic of China and internationally, operating in three segments: The Secondary Rechargeable Batteries and Photovoltaic; Mobile Phone Components, Assembly and Other Products; and Automobiles, Automobile-Related Products and Other Products. Among the growing number of EV stocks that are not tied to auto manufacturing but rather to EV charging-station infrastructure, Blink Charging offered early stakeholders quite a ride. Throughout the first half of 2020, BLNK was one of the stocks under $5 . Now, that narrative changed. Nevertheless, for EVs to roll out successfully, adequate charging infrastructure must exist. Blink serves a crucial role in this market, making it a relevant longer-term investment. ChargePoint Holdings Inc is an EV charging network provider committed to enabling the electrification of mobility for all people and goods. It is creating a new fueling network to move people and goods on electricity. Its cloud subscription platform and software-defined charging hardware are designed to include options for every charging scenario from home and multifamily to the workplace, parking, hospitality, retail, and transport fleets of all types. It provides access to several places to charge in North America and Europe. An iconic global brand, Volkswagen delivered German craftsmanship and precision engineering at a much more affordable price than its premium luxury competitors. Today, Volkswagen is an automotive powerhouse, controlling a wide range of companies, from its namesake brand to outfits like Lamborghini and Porsche. In fact, the latter is bringing electric transportation to the enthusiast market with the Porsche Taycan. Once a joke and a novelty, no one today laughs at Toyota, which stands among the automotive greats. While it gained market dominance through its inimitable reliability and dollar-for-value proposition, Toyota shifted its attention toward EVs and other alternative-fueled vehicles. Currently, the auto manufacturer is hard at work researching and developing a solid-state battery (SSB). If successful, this could impart a paradigm shift in the industry because of the SSB’s greater capacity and performance output. One of the most iconic American companies, Ford introduced the concept of automotive mass production through its assembly line. With that invention came this nation’s love for the open road. Later on, Ford and other American automakers started to lose their way. Fortunately, its groundbreaking Mustang Mach-E, an electric SUV that competes with Tesla’s Model Y, appears to have put the company back on track. Earlier this year, Ford was one of the stocks under $10 . For well over a century, the fossil fuels industry not only dominated the discussion regarding automotive transportation, it was the only topic available. But over the past several years, the auto industry went through a rethink thanks in no small part to Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Proving that electric vehicles (EVs) were not only fancy science projects but also commercially viable products, TSLA’s valuation soared to the stratosphere. Investors should learn about electric vehicle stocks as the EV market starts to keep pace with the gasoline car, bending the public’s ear and making every EV maker a little more visible. Now, the entire sector started pivoting toward EVs, catapulting a massive race for dominance. This dynamic potentially sets up an intriguing and profitable environment for the best electric vehicle stocks. Quick Look at the Best EV Stocks: Overview: Electric Vehicle Stocks When most hear “electric vehicle,” people instinctively think about Tesla. Undoubtedly, the technology and EV manufacturing firm brought the concept to the mainstream with a mix of sleek sedans and SUVs that consumers ravenously purchased. However, you may be surprised to learn that EVs go back centuries. The concept of a charging station, however, is a bit more recent. So, how can you get away from the gas station, invest in companies that are reaping tax credits and buy in on the ground floor of automakers that are changing the face of the industry? In fact, the history of Porsche, one of the world’s most revered performance-car brands, started out with an electric motor. In 1898, Ferdinand Porsche designed a rudimentary EV that had a top speed of 25 kilometers per hour (or approximately 15.5 miles per hour). Ferdinand went on to design the original Volkswagen (the car for the people,) but he could not have imagined what EV charging would be today, home charging options and how massive the vehicle market has become. Despite such early experiments, nothing could beat the energy density that fossil fuels provided. Though incredibly dirty, a gallon of gas can reliably fuel a vehicle for many miles (and often to a level determined by the manufacturer and printed on the sticker at the dealership.) This figure became such a big deal among drivers that many often purchased their vehicles based on gas mileage estimates alone. Further, drivers found it easier and quicker to refuel a car than to charge an EV. In fact, charging networks could make it even easier to charge car batteries for a road trip, daily commute, etc. For decades since, the energy-density advantage prevented non-fossil fuel alternatives from challenging combustion-based cars. But with the advancement of lithium-ion battery technology, EVs became much more practical, thereby stealing market share from combustion cars. As the market capitalization of many of these companies grows, car stocks can all be lifted on some level. Though steep challenges remain, many automotive experts consider EVs to be the future of transportation, which then leads to a potential opportunity for electric vehicle stocks. So, which auto stocks are the best bet for those who wish to diversify in both the energy and auto industries? The automotive industry gives you several options for diversification, including the Polestar 2, Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Silverado EV, Tesla Model S, Chevrolet Bolt EV and more. This means that you can gain exposure to the car industry through several manufacturers. Where to Buy EV Stocks Thanks to the ever-rising popularity of EVs, you can technically use any broker to acquire electric vehicle stocks. That said, if you’re really interested in this space, you should consider platforms that offer favorable terms for over-the-counter (OTC) stocks and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Why? Primarily, increased competition translates to foreign automakers researching and developing their own EVs. Ford Motor Company and General Motors are pushing forward with EVs, they often perform better than, for example, Rivian stock. Because many of these companies list their equity units on OTC markets, you should consider a brokerage that facilitates such trades with minimal fees. Also, new EV competitors increasingly choose SPACs as their vehicle to go public. To get in on the ground floor with such enterprises, you should research SPAC-friendly platforms. Below is a list of brokers for your consideration, remembering that when you go beyond the combustion engine, you will see a whole new side of the auto industry. This also means that you need to choose a broker that makes you feel comfortable and helps you get into the auto sector properly. Features to Look for Distinct product: Ask any consumer auto expert and more often than not, they recommend prospective buyers consider fundamental attributes such as reliability, cost of ownership and overall quality. But when it comes down to it, humans are visceral creatures. Backed by research and recognized by common sense, many people base their purchasing decisions on vehicle aesthetics. Therefore, it’s important that the core product is distinctive and resonates with the consumer base. Viable business plan: As recent EV-sector volatility demonstrated, EV stocks are not for the faint of heart. In some cases, EV firms are aspirational, with no earnings per share and no revenue to justify their valuation. Even Tesla sells its vehicles at a loss if you back out the company’s regulatory credit sales. Therefore, if you’re going to take a shot in this market, do so on a credible business plan. Leadership: Competing in the EV arena is arguably one of the most difficult settings. First, you have Tesla’s dominance. Second, EVs still only represent a fraction of global auto sales, translating to a massive hurdle in convincing the rest of the world to make the switch to electric. It can happen, but it’s going to take strong leadership. An Electrifying Opportunity When Ferdinand Porsche developed his electric motor, many in the automotive industry envisioned that electric power would rule the roadways. Even in the late 19th to early 20th century, the loud noise and pollution from combustion-based engines bothered onlookers. At that time, though, the technology to produce commercially appealing electric vehicles did not exist. Fast forward to today and the paradigm has completely shifted. That’s not to say that EV manufacturers don’t have challenges ahead because they do. But the opportunities are even greater, making this an exciting time to profit off a longstanding catalyst.

Electric Vehicle Policy,The Electricity Vehicle Policy launched by Science and Technology Minister Rna Tanveer Hussain with such fanfare in Islamabad tries to ignore the elephant in the room:where are electric vehicle owners supposed to get the electricity to charge their vehicles?,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/11/22/electric-vehicle-policy/,,2024-11-21 23:59:00,Pakistan Today,,"The Electricity Vehicle Policy launched by Science and Technology Minister Rna Tanveer Hussain with such fanfare in Islamabad tries to ignore the elephant in the room:where are electric vehicle owners supposed to get the electricity to charge their vehicles? The policy does call for 3000 charging stations to be set up, but slurs over who exactly is supposed to set them up. Another problem that will be faced is the viability of the national grid when this charging is taking place. The policy is quite ambitious, and rightly so, for it has provided for trucks and other heavy vehicles. The policy looks to 2060, when all vehicles on the roads will be electric. The payment of capacity charges is to be made possible by charging EV owners, but this raises the question of how would the burden of transmitting and distributing this electricity be managed. Perhaps in the same way that the government missed the point of solarization, it may be missing the point of electric vehicles. The government thought of solarization as consisting of huge solar parks, covered with solar panels as far as the eye could see, and generating power by the gigawatt for the national grid. It did not foresee the miniaturization of generation into small units, which the consumer can afford to make the capital investment. Similarly, the government assumes that the consumer will still get automotive power from filling stations, and therefore is giving targets for the number of charging points that must be set up. However, the whole point of electric vehicles is that they can be charged from a power point that does not have to be located above an underground reservoir, like a petrol pump. The price of fuel is already so high that a vehicle that can run even on grid-supplied electricity is going to be cheaper to run than one using conventional fuel. However, what happens to the filling stations, indeed the whole distribution system, when EVs start charging at home? Make the nightmare for the oil companies worse: what happens when charging is done by solar power? This does not include the next step, where car batteries are charged directly from solar power.

Balboa Peninsula Trolley ‘airport shuttles’ to be replaced with vehicles modeled after historic electric rail cars,"Most of the cost of the new shuttles as well as a seven-year extension of the trolley service were covered by a state grant, according to Newport Beach officials.",https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/story/2024-11-21/balboa-peninsula-trolleys-replaced-with-vintage-style-vehicles,,2024-11-21 18:18:00,Los Angeles Times,,"Newport Beach officials approved plans to replace the vehicles that look like “airport shuttles” running the Balboa Peninsula Trolley’s routes with some that are reminiscent of electric rail cars from the early 20th century, and they extended the local transit program for another seven years. The City Council awarded a $3,897,747 contract to LAZ Parkling California LLC at a meeting Tuesday. The company has been operating the Balboa Peninsula Trolley for the past seven years and also runs other shuttle services in Laguna Beach, Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, San Clemente and Irvine. For the record: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the source of grant funding for the extension of the Balboa Peninsula Trolley. It came from an Orange County Transportation Authority program. The city is contributing $641,027 in funding for the program. The remaining $3,274,720 is being covered by a grant via the Orange County Trasportation Authority. Advertisement The Balboa Peninsula Trolley currently operates during summer weekends and reaches 22 stops mostly along Balboa Avenue and Newport Boulevard. It carries about 20,000 riders each year, according to city staff reports. The service had made use of shuttle vans similar to what rental car companies and hotels use to transport people to and from airports. The contract approved Tuesday sets aside over $1.67 million for the purchase of new vehicles to replace them. The new shuttles are partially open to the environment, allowing riders to get fresh air and take in the atmosphere of the Peninsula. They are powered by compressed natural gas and modeled after vintage cable cars. It will take about a year to build them, so those won’t go into service until 2026. A rough example of shuttles modeled after classic rail cars that will go into service in Newport Beach the summer of 2026. (Courtesy of the city of Newport Beach via YouTube) “We’ve referred to this as the ‘airport shuttle’ for a long time because I look at a lot of friends up and down the peninsula who would never get on the current shuttle we’re operating,” Councilman Noah Blom said during a study session in September regarding the renewal of the trolley. “But somehow, when we have an open air red car, I believe we would.” At that study session, council members and city officials also discussed the possibility of expanding routes to reach Mariners Mile, Corona Del Mar and Newport Center. The cost of additional vehicles staffing and infrastructure to do so could cost roughly between $2 million and $4.7 million, depending on trip frequency and scheduling. “I’m very excited about the prospect of a citywide trolley system for Newport both for residents and for visitors,” Councilwoman Lauren Kleiman said in September. “The idea that we can spend less time in our cars, that we can amenity-hop throughout the city, that we can support our local businesses and relieve our neighborhoods from some of the parking burdens that exist, I’m all for.”",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides little originality, value, or purpose in the context of electric vehicles.

Diesel nur noch sechs Cent unter dem Benzinpreis,"Während der Benzinpreis gleich bleibt, rückt der Dieselpreis im Wochenvergleich bis auf 6 Cent heran. Das kostet Kraftstoff aktuell, so teuer ist Öko-Diesel HVO100! Dazu: Spartipps vor der Fahrt zur Tankstelle.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/aktueller-spritpreis-benzinpreis-dieselpreis-18678455.html,,2024-11-21 13:52:00,Matthias Brügge,,"Derzeit kostet Super E10 im Wochenmittel 1,655 Euro pro Liter, das ist keine Veränderung gegenüber der Vorwoche. Damit bleibt das Benzintanken im Prinzip günstig. Das hat die Spritpreis-Wochenauswertung des ADAC nach einer Abfrage bei mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen ergeben. Diesel kostet im Schnitt 1,595 pro Liter, das ist ein recht scharfer Anstieg um fast zwei Cent im Vergleich zur Vorwoche. Damit rückt der Dieselpreis bis auf sechs Cent an den Benzinpreis heran – und das bei einer steuerlichen Begünstigung von 18,4 Cent pro Liter. Der Grund liegt in der wachsenden Nachfrage nach dem dieselähnlichen Heizöl in der Winterzeit. Erneut stieg der Rohölpreis für das Fass (159 Liter) leicht auf 73 Dollar, der Euro notierte zuletzt weiter schwach mit 1,06 Dollar, mit schwacher Tendenz – was sich preishebend auf das in Dollar gehandelte Öl auswirkt. Clever Tanken Minutengenauer Spritpreis-Check So steht der Spritpreis an Tankstellen in der Umgebung! Zum Angebot Zum Angebot In Kooperation mit Zoom Der Benzinpreis bleibt gleich, nur Diesel wird spürbar teurer, die Steuerschere schließt sich: Super E10 steht weiter bei 1,66 Euro/Liter, Diesel steigt auf 1,60 Euro. Bild: ADAC Was kostet HVO100 an Tankstellen in Deutschland? Der Preis für den alternativen Dieselkraftstoff HVO100 zieht derzeit an, begründet durch eine steigende Nachfrage nach dem erneuerbaren Diesel. Bei mehreren Stichproben quer durch Deutschland notierte der Liter des Biosprits zuletzt zwischen 1,73 bis 1,83 Euro pro Liter. Die Zahl der Anbieter von HVO steigt. Wegen der energieintensiven Produktion ist der Kraftstoff teurer, er ist aber auch von der CO2-Abgabe befreit. (Überblick: Hier finden Sie HVO-Tankstellen!) Was kostete Sprit im Oktober? Der vergangene Monat Oktober brachte den Autofahrern nach fünf Monaten sinkender Kraftstoffpreise eine moderate Preissteigerung bei Benzin und Diesel, hat das Verbraucherportal Clever Tanken (gehört zur AUTO BILD-Gruppe) errechnet. So stieg der Preis für den Liter Super E10 im Oktober im Bundesdurchschnitt auf 1,6626 Euro, ein Plus von zwei Cent gegenüber September. Diesel kostete mit 1,5640 Euro pro Liter rund drei Cent mehr als im September. Grund war der steigende Rohölpreis und ein schwächerer Euro, erklärte Steffen Bock, der Gründer und Geschäftsführer von Clever Tanken. Im Oktober kosteten vier Tankfüllungen à 60 Liter Super E10 somit im Schnitt 399,02 Euro, also rund 5,09 Euro mehr als im Vormonat. Gegenüber Oktober 2023 war der Preis um 15 Cent gesunken. Bei viermaligem Tanken von je 60 Liter sparte man so 36,72 Euro gegenüber dem Vorjahresmonat. Das Dieseltanken kostete auf vier Tankfüllungen rund 375,36 Euro – etwa 6,26 Euro mehr als im September. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahresmonat kostete Diesel zuletzt satte 25,7 Cent pro Liter weniger. Damit war das viermalige Tanken etwa 61,73 Euro günstiger als im Oktober 2023. Die Preisschere zwischen Diesel und Benzin verringerte sich den zweiten Monat in Folge: Im September kostete Benzin rund 10 Cent mehr als Diesel. Da ein Liter Benzin mit rund 20 Cent mehr Energiesteuer belastet ist, wäre Potenzial, Diesel nochmals zehn Cent günstiger pro Liter anzubieten. Aber Steffen Bock rechnet mit einem steigenden Dieselpreis, bedingt durch verstärkte saisonale Nachfrage. Wie sich die weiter steigende CO2-Abgabe auf den Spritpreis auswirkt Wie sich die weiter steigende CO2-Abgabe auf den Spritpreis auswirkt Jahr CO2-Preis/Tonne Preisaufschlag/Liter Benzin Preisaufschlag/Liter Diesel 2021 25 Euro ca. 7 Cent ca. 8 Cent 2022 30 Euro ca. 8,4 Cent ca. 9,5 Cent 2023 bleibt bei 30 Euro ca. 8,4 Cent ca. 9,5 Cent 2024 45 Euro ca. 12,7 Cent ca. 14,2 Cent 2025 55 Euro ca. 15,7 Cent ca. 17,2 Cent 2026 55 - 65 Euro ca. 18,6 Cent ca. 20,8 Cent 2027 freie Preisbildung im Emissionshandel noch nicht bekannt noch nicht bekannt Wie viel zahlt man mehr für Sprit an Autobahntankstellen? Wer im Auto im Land unterwegs ist, den könnte ein Check der deutschen Autobahnraststätten interessieren. Eine Analyse des ADAC ergab, dass dort der Kraftstoff im Verhältnis zu umliegenden Tankstellen teils massiv überteuert ist. Der Autoclub registrierte Preisunterschiede von bis zu 69,9 Cent pro Liter! Autofahrer sollten also für den Tankstopp die Autobahn verlassen und die nächstgelegene Tankstelle im Umland aufsuchen. Bei der Bestpreissuche helfen Apps wie die von Clever Tanken. (Tipps zum richtigen Zeitpunkt fürs Tanken!) Zoom An der Autobahntankstelle ist Kraftstoff teils 70 Cent pro Liter teurer als im Umland. Bild: Sven Krieger Auf Grundlage der Erhebungen an 40 deutschen Autobahntankstellen rechnet der ADAC vor: Bei einem 50-Liter-Tank sparen Autofahrer, die statt an der Raststätte im Umland tanken, im Schnitt 20,86 Liter im Benziner. Im Diesel ist die Ersparnis mit 17,96 Euro kaum niedriger. Fazit des ADAC: ""Tanken neben der Autobahn lohnt sich im Grunde immer."" Was kosten Benzin und Diesel aktuell in Europa? Wer nahe der deutschen Grenze wohnt oder eine Urlaubsreise mit dem Auto plant, den dürften die Spritpreise im europäischen Ausland interessieren. So teuer ist Sprit im europäischen Ausland So teuer ist Sprit im europäischen Ausland Land Literpreis Super Literpreis Diesel Belgien 1,68 Euro 1,75 Euro Dänemark 2,09 Euro 1,79 Euro Deutschland* 1,78 Euro 1,64 Euro Frankreich 1,85 Euro 1,72 Euro Griechenland 1,91 Euro 1,67 Euro Italien 1,87 Euro 1,75 Euro Kroatien 1,60 Euro 1,61 Euro Luxemburg 1,60 Euro 1,53 Euro Niederlande 2,02 Euro 1,76 Euro Österreich 1,63 Euro 1,63 Euro Polen 1,52 Euro 1,53 Euro Portugal 1,75 Euro 1,60 Euro Schweden 1,65 Euro 1,63 Euro Schweiz** 1,92 Euro 1,98 Euro Slowakei 1,62 Euro 1,54 Euro Slowenien 1,47 Euro 1,50 Euro Spanien 1,63 Euro 1,50 Euro Tschechien 1,53 Euro 1,48 Euro Ungarn 1,56 Euro 1,59 Euro Aktuell lohnt sich Tanktourismus vor allem mit Blick auf die Alpenregion und zu unseren östlichen Nachbarn: In Polen ist Sprit deutlich günstiger, in Kroatien, der Slowakei, Slowenien, Tschechien und Ungarn ebenfalls. Zoom Beim Tanken in Italien kostet Diesel rund 1,80 Euro pro Liter, der Liter Superbenzin 1,88 Euro (Preise vom Juli 2024). Bild: Michael Bihlmayer In Richtung Norden (Dänemark) oder Westen (Frankreich) kann es teils deutlich teurer werden, mit Ausnahme von Belgien und Luxemburg oder Schweden, wo man wieder deutlich günstiger tankt als hierzulande. In Österreich ist nur Benzin günstiger, allerdings um gleich 15 Cent pro Liter. Die Preise sind nur als Größenordnung zu verstehen und nicht 1:1 mit Deutschland vergleichbar. Zudem können auch im Ausland zum Teil starke regionale Unterschiede herrschen. Wie teuer war das Tankjahr 2023? Im Jahresmittel war 2023 das zweitteuerste Tankjahr seit Beginn der Berechnung durch Clever Tanken im Jahr 2012. Im Bundesdurchschnitt kostete der Liter Super E10 1,7937 Euro, für den Liter Diesel waren 1,7257 Euro zu entrichten. Das Tanken war nur 2022 teurer, als der Liter Super E10 im Jahresdurchschnitt 1,8645 Euro kostete, der Liter Diesel 1,9522 Euro. Ein großer Teil des Spritpreises in Deutschland sind Steuern und Abgaben. Die Energie- bzw. Mineralölsteuer macht bei Superbenzin rund 80 Cent pro Liter aus, bei Diesel sind es etwa 70 Cent. Theoretisch müsste Diesel also stets mindestens zehn Cent günstiger sein. Durch schwankende Preise im Großhandel, andere Nachfrage und Sonderfälle wie den Ukraine-Krieg sieht es in der Realität an der Tankstelle aber oft anders aus. Hinzu kommt seit Jahresbeginn 2021 der CO 2 -Preis. Der Rest teilt sich auf in den Preis für Rohöl und Kosten für die Weiterverarbeitung, Transport, Tankstellen sowie den Gewinn der Mineralölwirtschaft. Und obendrauf kommt dann noch die Mehrwertsteuer von 19 Prozent. Wie hoch ist der CO 2 -Preis für Benzin und Diesel? Mit Beginn der CO 2 -Bepreisung zum 1. Januar 2021 mit 25 Euro je Tonne CO 2 stieg der Benzinpreis um 7,0 Cent pro Liter, der für Diesel um 7,9 Cent. 2022 wurde der CO 2 -Preis auf 30 Euro pro Tonne erhöht, verteuerte Super E10 um weitere 1,4 Cent und Diesel um 1,6 Cent. Die dritte Stufe erfolgte erst zum 1. Januar 2024. Insgesamt macht die CO 2 -Steuer jetzt einen Anteil von rund 12,7 Cent pro Liter Benzin E10 bzw. 14,2 Cent pro Liter Diesel aus. Zu welcher Tageszeit tankt man günstig? Clever-Tanken-Gründer Steffen Bock rät, vor der Fahrt zur Tankstelle auf den richtigen Zeitpunkt zum Tanken zu achten: ""Gravierender als die Schwankungen an einzelnen Tagen sind die Preissprünge, die wir an Tankstellen über den Tag verteilt beobachten."" Diese könnten an derselben Tankstelle schon mal bis zu 15 Cent, in einer Stadt sogar bis zu 22 Cent pro Liter betragen. Überhaupt ist das Tanken am Abend zu empfehlen. Laut einer ADAC-Auswertung sind die Spritpreise zwischen 19 und 20 Uhr sowie zwischen 21 und 22 Uhr am niedrigsten. Aber auch der Zeitraum zwischen 18 und 19 Uhr ist bereits relativ günstig. Teuerster Tankzeitpunkt ist kurz nach 7 Uhr morgens. Dann verlangen die Tankstellen im Mittel 6,4 Cent pro Liter mehr, für Diesel sind es 7,3 Cent. Zwischen 5 und 11 Uhr schwanken die Preise recht stark und liegen fast immer über dem Niveau des restlichen Tages. Wer also zur richtigen Zeit tankt, kann bei einer Tankfüllung von 50 Litern satte 6 Euro sparen, dies gilt für Super E10 wie für Diesel. Und wer anstelle von Super E5 das stärker mit Bio-Ethanol versetzte E10 tankt, spart weitere 6 Cent pro Liter. (So viel Sprit darf man bunkern!)

Gebrauchtwagenmarkt Maserati Ghibli Maserati Ghibli II Tipo AM336 Preis:39.900 € 64.199 km 64.199 km 225 kW ( 306 PS) 225 kW ( 306 PS) 06/1997 Zum Angebot Von solchen Preisregionen ist der zweite Ghibli weit entfernt. Das hier angebotene Modell mit dem für den italienischen Markt konzipierten 2,0-Liter-V6 (um die damals in Italien drastisch höhere Besteuerung von Autos mit über 2,0 Liter Hubraum zu umgehen) soll 39.900 Euro kosten. Nicht günstig, doch die niedrige Laufleistung von 64.000 Kilometern und die Erstzulassung im letzten Produktionsjahr (1997) sprechen für das Exemplar. Im Laufe der Bauzeit sorgte Fiat nämlich für zahlreiche Qualitätsverbesserungen. Der Ghibli entstand unter Fiats Regentschaft Fiat hatte Maserati Anfang der 1990er von De Tomaso übernommen, De Tomaso wiederum verantwortete die Biturbo-Modellreihe, die in den 1980er-Jahren eingeführt wurde. Der zweite Ghibli nutzte als später Nachfahre dieser Modellreihe deren Plattformtechnik. Um die problematische Qualität der Biturbo-Modellreihe ranken sich wahre Schauergeschichten, doch technisch ist der Ghibli zweifelsohne das ausgereifteste Modell dieser Biturbo-Ära. Zoom Lang wie ein Golf (4,22 Meter), stark wie ein Porsche: Aus zwei Litern Hubraum schöpft der Biturbo-V6 306 PS. Für Exportmärkte gab es einen 2,8-Liter-V6 mit 284 PS. Das Gewicht liegt um 1,4 Tonnen.

Zum Angebot Nach dem Facelift im Jahr 1994 verfügte der ausschließlich als Coupé gebaute Sportler über ein optimiertes und elektrisch verstellbares Fahrwerk, das für damalige Zeiten eine weite Spreizung bietet. Zudem bekam das Getrag-Schaltgetriebe einen sechsten Gang spendiert. Und es gab kleine Designanpassungen, wie breitere Schürzen und ein neues Firmenlogo. Ghibli mit gefälliger Farbkombination Einige Ghibli aus den 1990er-Jahren besitzen teils abenteuerliche Farbkombinationen, die schrillen Töne in den Innenräumen sind nicht immer leicht zu verkraften. Das vom Autohaus Gassmann angebotene Modell gehört mit seiner ansehnlichen Conolly-Lederausstattung in Dunkelblau zu den farblich gefälligen Versionen. Zudem passt der Lederton sehr gut zum silbernen Lack. Zoom Gefällige Farbgebung auch im Innenraum. Ghibli-Exemplare der zweiten Generation verließen die Werkshallen auch mit mintgrünen oder gelben Innenausstattungen. Bild: Gassmann GmbH Inzwischen typisch für Maserati ist die oval geformte analoge Uhr auf dem Armaturenbrett. Das Designelement war damals aber noch recht jung und sollte die neue Ausrichtung der Marke unterstreichen. Maserati wollte nicht als Sportwagenbauer, sondern als Hersteller von stilvollen, luxuriösen und sportlichen Fahrzeugen verstanden werden. Reminiszenz an den BMW M3 E30 Gezeichnet wurde der Ghibli AM336 übrigens vom grandiosen Designer Marcello Gandini, der im März 2024 im Alter von 85 Jahren verstarb. Der Italiener schuf viele Sportwagenlegenden wie Lamborghini Miura und Countach Alfa Romeo Montreal oder Lancia Stratos , aber auch den Kleinwagen Audi 50 .

Mit den STLA-Plattformen ändert sich das. Während STLA Medium, STLA Large und STLA Frame bereits vorgestellt wurden, bleibt die Version STLA Small noch weitgehend im Dunklen. Doch nun gibt es Aussagen von Konzernchef Carlos Tavares dazu. Die Plattform STLA Small soll 2026 starten, hieß es im Jahr 2021. Damit war schon damals klar, dass die kleinste STLA-Architektur als letzte auf den Markt kommt. Man liege zeitlich auf Kurs für einen Marktstart im Jahr 2026, sagte nun Tavares. Die Plattform werde zwischen Ende 2025 und Anfang 2026 vorgestellt, verriet er gegenüber Autocar. Sie werde für die nächste Kleinwagengeneration des Konzerns eingesetzt, also wohl für die Nachfolger des Peugeot E-208 (unser Titelbild) und des Opel Corsa Electric. Der Zeitplan von Stellantis für die Einführung der STLA-Plattformen von 2021 ist offenbar noch immer gültig Doch kann die Plattform Autos vom A- bis zum C-Segment tragen, also auch Kleinst- und Kompaktwagen. Die kleinsten Fahrzeuge auf Basis von STLA Small sollen 3.600 mm lang sein, also noch kürzer als der Fiat 500 Elektro mit seinen 3,63 Metern oder der Leapmotor T03 mit 3,62 Metern. Neben Elektroantrieben sollen auch Hybride unterstützt werden. Die Plattform soll die Common Modular Platform CMP samt ihrer elektrifizierten Variante e-CMP ersetzen, die Kleinwagen wie den Peugeot E-208, aber auch kleine Elektro-SUVs wie den Opel Mokka Electric trägt. STLA Small wird höher positioniert als die Smart Car Plattform, die unter anderem den Citroen e-C3 trägt, aber unterhalb von STLA Medium. Die Elektroautos werden Batterien zwischen 37 und 82 kWh haben, die Antriebe sollen bei 70 kW beginnen. Mit 82 kWh hätte der größte Akku so viel Speicherkapazität wie die mittelgroße Batterie im Opel Grandland Electric, der auf STLA Medium basiert und bis zu 582 km Reichweite hat. Ein Kleinwagen käme mit einer solchen Batterie locker über 600 km. ""Ich glaube, dass wir diese [die STLA-Small-Plattform] höchstwahrscheinlich Ende 2025 oder Anfang 2026 vorstellen werden, abhängig von der ersten Anwendung [also das erste darauf basierende Fahrzeug], die sich jetzt in der Vorbereitungsphase befindet“, sagte Tavares. Wie man an der Vorstellung der ersten drei Plattform sehe, liege man im Zeitplan. Unter dem Strich Von den vier geplanten STLA-Plattformen sind nun drei vorgestellt, STLA Small wird erst in einem Jahr präsentiert. Das erste darauf basierende Auto könnte gut und gern der Peugeot E-208 sein, der schon 2019 startete. Vermutlich wird die Palette dann endlich vielfältiger, denn bisher bietet der Kleinwagen nur 100 oder 115 kW sowie Akkus mit 50 oder 51 kWh brutto.

November 2024 | Tobias Stahl Stellantis hat seine nunmehr dritte Multi-Antriebsplattform „STLA Frame“ auf den Markt gebracht. Die Fahrzeugplattform soll bei Pick-ups, Lieferwagen und anderen größeren Fahrzeugen, bei denen die Karosserie auf einen Rahmen aufgesetzt ist, zum Einsatz kommen. Artikel teilen Artikel teilen Artikel teilen In die Zwischenablage kopiert Stellantis hat den Marktstart einer neuen Fahrzeugplattform bekannt gegeben. Die neue Multi-Antriebsplattform STLA Frame ist speziell zur „Unterstützung der Full-Size Pickup-Trucks, der leichten Nutzfahrzeuge und der SUVs von Stellantis“ gedacht. Sie soll als erstes bei Fahrzeugen der Marken Ram und Jeep zum Einsatz kommen und ist somit vorrangig für den nordamerikanischen Markt gedacht. Die Plattform ist als vollständig batterieelektrische Variante sowie als „Range Extended Electric Vehicle“ (REEV), also als Elektroplattform mit benzinbetriebenem Reichweitenverlängerer verfügbar. In Zukunft könne STLA Frame auch für Verbrennungsmotoren, Hybrid- sowie Wasserstoffantriebe genutzt werden, erklärt das Markenkonglomerat in einer Pressemitteilung. Damit klingt der Anwendungsbereich der Fahrzeugplattform deutlich größer als noch vor einigen Jahren – 2021 hatte Stellantis bei der Ankündigung seiner Plattform-Strategie vor allem auf den Einsatz als Elektro- und Plug-in-Hybrid-Plattform hingewiesen. Anzeige Für den US-Markt: Stellantis setzt auf benzinbetriebene Reichweitenverlängerer Mit dem von Stellantis angekündigten REEV-System, das eine Batterie, vordere und hintere elektrische Antriebsmodule (EDMs), einen fossil betriebenen On-Board-Generator in Form eines Verbrennungsmotors kombiniert, sollen Fahrer schwere Lasten über längeren Strecke transportieren oder ziehen können. Da es keinen direkten mechanischen Weg vom Motor zu den Rädern gibt, versorgt der Generator die elektrischen Antriebsmodule mit Strom, um das Fahrzeug anzutreiben, und lädt nach Bedarf die Batterie auf. Stellantis-CEO Carlos Tavares kommentiert den nun wieder stärker auf Technologieoffenheit bedachten Ansatz: „Mit der neuen Technologie für BEVs und REEVs bieten wir Käuferinnen und Käufern, die heute möglicherweise noch zögerlich sind, ihr erstes Elektrofahrzeug auszuprobieren, bald Lösungen ohne Kompromisse. Wir sind stolz auf dieses technische Highlight und freuen uns darauf, es in unserer bevorstehenden Produktoffensive für Jeep und Ram zum Leben zu erwecken. STLA Frame besteht aus hochfestem Stahl und soll verbesserte Haltbarkeit und Steifigkeit bei geringerem Gewicht bieten. Im verbreiterten Mittelteil der Plattform befindet sich das Akkupack mit verstärkten Rahmenschienen, die den Energiespeicher im Falle eines Seitenaufpralls schützen sollen. Eine durchgehende Bauchwanne reduziert den Luftwiderstand und soll so zur Maximierung der Reichweite beitragen. 250 kW Antriebsleistung, Schnellladen mit 350 kW: Das kann die neue Stellantis-Plattform Die Plattform soll für eine reine Elektro-Reichweite von bis zu 800 Kilometern und eine REEV-Reichweite von bis zu 1.100 Kilometern ausgelegt sein. Insgesamt bietet sie Platz für flüssigkeitsgekühlte Akkupacks mit 159 bis über 200 kWh Speichervermögen. Die von Stellantis entwickelten und montierten Front- und Heck-E-Maschinen leisten laut Hersteller bis zu 250 kW und bieten Allradantrieb. Flexible Federungsdesigns, einschließlich der Option für Luftfederung, sollen Optimierungsmöglichkeiten für verschiedene Fahrbedingungen und Beladungsszenarien bieten. Die maximale Anhängelast der Plattform beträgt 6.350 Kilogramm, die Nutzlast liegt bei 1.224 Kilogramm. Darüber hinaus ermöglicht die Plattform den Bau von Fahrzeugen, mit denen man durch bis zu 61 Zentimeter tiefes Wasser fahren kann. Batterieelektrische Modelle können auf der Plattform mit 800-Volt-DC-Schnellladung Ladeleistungen von bis zu 350 kW erreichen und somit binnen zehn Minuten rund 161 Kilometer Reichweite nachladen, rechnet Stellantis vor. Bei REEVs mit einer 400-Volt-DC-Schnellladung mit bis zu 175 kW seien in zehn Minuten bis zu 80 Kilometer zusätzlicher Reichweite möglich.

Europe Car Sales Stagnate as Electric Vehicle Weakness Persists,"Car sales in Europe are flatlining, leading manufacturers including Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to push for cost cuts in response to muted demand.",https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/11/21/europe-car-sales-stagnate-as-electric-vehicle-weakness-persists/,,2024-11-21 06:00:00,bnnbloomberg,,"(Bloomberg) -- Car sales in Europe are flatlining, leading manufacturers including Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG to push for cost cuts in response to muted demand. New-car registrations inched up just 0.1% in October compared to a year ago, to 1.04 million units, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Thursday. Declines in France, Italy and the UK largely canceled out expansion in Germany, the region’s biggest car market. Automakers have struggled to grow sales in Europe as the transition to electric vehicles stumbles and a cost-of-living squeeze crimps budgets. Ford on Wednesday announced plans to cut another 4,000 jobs in the region, about 14% of its local workforce. Volkswagen is pushing for savings measures including unprecedented plant closures in Germany. Although EV sales rose 6.9% last month, they remain down for the year after policymakers reduced support for EV purchases. The UK, where registrations jumped 24% in October, has been a bright spot as manufacturers offer significant discounts to meet the government’s zero-emissions vehicle sales mandate. In Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government scrapped aid late last year, EV sales declined 4.9% in October, and are down more than a quarter after the first ten months. Porsche AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG have dialed back their EV ambitions in recent months, citing slower-than-expected momentum for plug-in models. While the German government has been weighing reintroducing some aid to support its beleaguered carmakers, it’s unclear whether it can go ahead after Scholz’s ruling coalition collapsed, inhibiting its ability to act decisively before early elections. A Europe-wide EV downturn increases the risk that manufacturers including VW, Stellantis NV and Renault SA will end up having to pay billions of euros in fines if they fail to meet stricter fleet-emission rules set to kick in next year. Buyers instead are gravitating toward hybrid vehicles powered by a combustion engine and a smaller battery, benefiting manufacturers led by Toyota Motor Corp. Sales of hybrids rose 16% last month. Volkswagen, which is locked in negotiations with unions over widespread cost cuts in Germany, saw registrations increase 13% in October. Stellantis’s sales declined 17% in the same period. --With assistance from Craig Trudell. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",Business,bing,"The article presents information primarily focused on the stagnation of car sales in Europe, touching upon the weaknesses in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Dann ist dieser Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 genau das richtige Auto! Vom Sondermodell Tommi Mäkinen Edition wurden nur 5000 Exemplare gebaut, wovon gerade mal 300 nach Europa gingen. In Deutschland ist der Evo 6 TME eine absolute Rarität! Die Geschichte des Lancer Evo Die 24-jährige Erfolgsgeschichte begann im Jahr 1992 mit dem Evo I, einer 250 PS starken Sportversion des recht biederen Lancer. In den folgenden Jahren wurde der Evo kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und war dabei stets ganz nah dran am Rallye-Auto. Hier bekamen die Kunden tatsächlich Rennsport-Technik für die Straße. Zoom Das Auto befindet sich bereits in Deutschland und ist verzollt. Für die Zulassung muss eine 21er-Vollabnahme durchgeführt werden. Bild: Autoscout24 Im Jahr 1999 konnte Werksfahrer Tommi Mäkinen den vierten aufeinanderfolgenden WRC-Fahrertitel mit einem Lancer Evo VI gewinnen. Grund genug für Mitsubishi , ein Sondermodell aufzulegen, das nach der finnischen Rallye-Legende benannt und dem originalen WRC-Auto nachempfunden war. Im Dezember desselben Jahres wurde der Lancer Evo VI Tommi Mäkinen Edition (kurz TME) präsentiert und ging ab dem 8. Januar 2000 für 3 .278.000 Yen (nach heutigem Stand knapp 20.000 Euro) in den Verkauf. Was die Stückzahlen betrifft, gibt es unterschiedliche Aussagen. Je nach Quelle sollen zwischen 2500 und 5000 Lancer Evo VI TME gebaut worden sein. Nur 300 TME für Europa Als sicher gilt, dass nur 300 Autos (darunter lediglich 124 Linkslenker) nach Europa gingen. An dem in mehreren Farben erhältlichen Sondermodell wurden zahlreiche Modifikationen vorgenommen. Neben dem charakteristischen Sticker-Dekor wurden alle TME mit weißen Enkei-Felgen ausgeliefert. Der Zweiliter-Vierzylinder (4G63t) wurde ebenfalls überarbeitet und mit einem größeren Turbolader versehen. Die Leistung blieb mit 280 PS jedoch identisch – zumindest offiziell. Bis heute gilt der Vierzylinder übrigens als einer der ausgereiftesten und haltbarsten Turbomotoren der Welt, der sogar 1000 PS und mehr verkraftet. Sondermodell wird auch Evo 6.5 genannt Der TME wurde darüber hinaus mit einer angepassten Lenkübersetzung, einer Tieferlegung, speziellen rot/schwarzen Recarositzen und einem Momo-Lederlenkrad ausgeliefert. In Summe waren die Anpassungen so groß, dass das Sondermodell inoffiziell oft auch Evo 6.5 genannt wird. Zoom Der Innenraum sieht aus, wie bei einem Jahreswagen. Das Momo-Lenkrad ist nicht speckig, die Recarositze sind nicht verschlissen.

Auf den Fotos macht er einen extrem gepflegten Eindruck. Laut Inseratstext wurde das Auto ursprünglich in Japan ausgeliefert, von wo es seinen Weg nach Hongkong fand. Während eines vierjährigen Auslandsaufenthalts erwarb der aktuelle Besitzer das Auto in Hongkong und nahm es bei seiner Rückkehr mit nach Deutschland. Der Evo ist bereits verzollt, aber noch nicht zugelassen. Für die Zulassung ist eine Vollabnahme nach § 21 StVZO nötig, bei der der Verkäufer, je nach Absprache, behilflich sein kann. Laut des Anbieters wurde der TME in seinem Besitz sehr gepflegt, so wurde zum Beispiel alle 5000 Kilometer ein Ölwechsel durchgeführt und dem Evo erst kürzlich ein neuer Zahnriemen und ein großer Service spendiert. In der Zwischenzeit stand das Auto immer trocken und soll demnach rostfrei sein.

"Elektronische Helfer, die den Putzlappen schwingen",Saubere Böden auf Knopfdruck: Saugroboter mit integrierter Wischfunktion entfernen effizient Schmutz und Dreck auf verschiedenen Oberflächen. AUTO BILD hat Modellen aus unterschiedlicher Preissegmente getestet.,https://www.autobild.de/produkttests/wischroboter-test-25111841.html,,2024-11-21 05:00:00,Timo Schurwanz,,"Für Besitzer von Laminat, Parkett und Fliesen sind leistungsstarke Wischfunktionen essentiell, und genau hier punkten Saug- und Wischroboter. Insbesondere Modelle mit Dockingstation erweisen sich im Test als vielversprechend. Sie bieten nicht nur effiziente Wischfunktionen, sondern kümmern sich auch um eine intelligente Wasserversorgung und Selbstreinigung. AUTO BILD hat zahlreiche dieser Wischroboter untersucht und stellt heraus, welche Modelle besonders beeindrucken. Im nächsten Abschnitt erfahren Sie, worauf es beim Wischen ankommt und welche Wischmethode als die effektivste gilt. Roborock setzt mit dem Roborock S8 Pro Ultra neue Maßstäbe im Bereich des smarten Saugens und Wischens. Als Marktführer baut das Unternehmen seinen Vorsprung mit diesem Topmodell weiter aus. Im Test überzeugte kein anderer Saug- und Wischroboter so sehr in puncto Reinigungsleistung und Intelligenz. Test-Empfehlung 2,6 befriedigend Roborock S7 Pro Ultra 2,6 befriedigend Dock mit Absaugfunktion und Wassertanks Teppicherkennung Gute Saug- und Wischleistung Erkennt Hindernisse, aber kaum kleinere Gegenstände Mitunter etwas laut Zum Angebot Das Roborock S8 Pro Ultra zeigt sich nicht nur als äußerst effizienter Staubsauger und Wischer, sondern auch als geschickter Navigator, der Hindernisse souverän meidet. Die Dockingstation des Topmodells ermöglicht nicht nur die Versorgung mit Staub und Wischwasser, sondern kümmert sich auch um die Selbstreinigung und das Trocknen des Wischtuchs. Diese smarten Funktionen haben jedoch ihren Preis: Das Roborock S8 Pro Ultra ist mit 1.399 Euro (Preis zum Testzeitpunkt) kein Schnäppchen. Aufgrund seiner Beliebtheit ist das Gerät oft ausverkauft. Als gute Alternative bietet sich der Vorgänger Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra aus dem Jahr 2022 an (1.115 Euro), der zwar auf die Trockenfunktion verzichtet, dafür jedoch mit einer integrierten Kamera zur Heimüberwachung ausgestattet ist. Dreame könnte beim Bot W10 mit dem ""W"" durchaus für Wischen stehen. Der Dreame Bot W10 (Preis zum Testzeitpunkt: 579 Euro) erweist sich als gründlicher und ausdauernder Wischroboter. Mit seiner intelligenten Reinigungsleistung und praktischen Funktionen bietet er ein beeindruckendes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Test-Empfehlung 2,8 befriedigend Dreame W10 2,8 befriedigend Alexa- und App-Steuerung Kräftiges Wischen Smarte Lasernavigation Dock mit Wasserversorgung und Selbstreinigung Erkennt kaum kleinere Gegenstände Staubbox im Dock nicht entleerbar Keine Absaugfunktion Zum Angebot Nach dem Nasswischen sorgt der Dreame Bot W10 dafür, dass seine rotierenden Wischpads mit warmer Luft effizient getrocknet werden. Diese Funktion kann dazu beitragen, unangenehme Gerüche und Schimmelbildung zu verhindern. Einziges Manko: Das Fehlen einer Absaugfunktion oder einer großzügigen, leicht entnehmbaren Staubbox direkt am Roboter. Einst als nette Zugabe betrachtet, haben moderne Putzroboter mittlerweile echtes Wischtalent entwickelt. Fast alle aktuellen Modelle sind Hybride, die auch das Wischen übernehmen. Die Tester überprüfen, ob die Geräte den Boden lediglich auf Hochglanz polieren oder auch hartnäckigen Schmutz und eingetrocknete Flecken entfernen können. Dabei ist es wichtig, dass der Teppich trocken bleibt: Bleibt der Roboter brav vom Teppichen fern, oder wischt er ungeniert darüber und setzt den geliebten Flokati unter Wasser? Zoom Größenvergleich (von links nach rechts): Der Ecovacs ragt über die anderen heraus. Im Vergleich dazu erscheint der Dreame kompakt. Noch schlanker sind die Stationen von Roborock und Yeedi. Bild: AUTO BILD Schon länger sind Modelle mit einer praktischen Absaugstation auf dem Markt, die automatisch den kleinen Schmutzbehälter des Saugers leert. Die hier getesteten Spitzenmodelle gehen in der Selbstständigkeit noch einen Schritt weiter. Anstelle dessen, dass Nutzerinnen und Nutzer regelmäßig den Staubbehälter im Roboter leeren, den Wassertank auffüllen und die Wischmatte von Schmutz und Gerüchen befreien müssen, übernimmt bei diesen Wisch-Saugrobotern eine Dockingstation diese Aufgaben. Diese zusätzliche Unabhängigkeit wird natürlich besonders positiv bewertet. Ein hochwertiger Wischroboter muss nicht nur gut wischen, sondern auch effektiv saugen können. Um die Leistungsfähigkeit beim intelligenten Putzen zu prüfen, setzen die Tester nach einigen Erkundungsrunden der Räumlichkeiten für jeden Saugroboter einen ""Köder"" aus: 100 Gramm Schmutz, bestehend aus 70 Gramm Katzenstreu, 20 Gramm Müsli und 10 Gramm Holzspänen. Dann müssen die Reinigungsroboter zeigen, wie effektiv sie dieses Gemisch von Teppich-, Parkett- und PVC-Boden aufnehmen können. Ein weiteres wichtiges Kriterium ist, wie sorgfältig die intelligenten Geräte an Ecken und Kanten oder um Tischbeine herum arbeiten. Auch in diesem Bereich prüft AUTO BILD genau hin. Zusätzlich werden Navigation, Bedienung und smarte Funktionen der Geräte, ihre Lautstärke sowie die Ausdauer beim Putzen auf den Prüfstand gestellt. Wischlappen ziehen Nahezu jeder halbwegs moderne Saugroboter verfügt über eine integrierte Wischfunktion. Das häufige Problem dabei ist, dass der Roboter den Putzlappen mit wenig Druck hinter sich herzieht und die kleinen Wassertanks an Bord nur wenig Wasser auf den Boden abgeben. In Tests sorgt dies zwar für etwas Glanz, beseitigt jedoch keine hartnäckigen Verschmutzungen. Zoom Mit rotierenden Wischpads anstelle von einem Wischlappen schrubben Ecovacs (Bild), Dreame und Yeedi. Bild: Ecovacs Wischmopps rotieren lassen Spezielle Wischroboter gehen einen Schritt weiter und sind auf der Unterseite nicht mit einem Putzlappen, sondern mit schnell rotierenden Wischpads ausgestattet. Sie bearbeiten Fliesen und Laminat mit mehr Druck, zeigen jedoch gewisse Schwächen. Das Ergebnis ist oft ein kräftiges, aber ungleichmäßiges Wischen, das Schlieren hinterlassen und Kanten auslassen kann. Zudem bleiben die Wischpads oft am Teppichrand hängen. Wischlappen vibrieren und anheben lassen Der chinesische Marktführer Roborock geht einen eigenen Weg beim Wischen und setzt auf ""VibraRise"". Dieses System schrubbt mit bis zu 3000 Rüttelbewegungen pro Minute über den Boden, wobei Vibrationsmodule die Wischplatte ordentlich in Schwung bringen. In Tests erzielte diese Technologie Bestleistungen und entfernte sogar hartnäckige Flecken, die bereits angetrocknet waren. Eine weitere clevere Funktion ist die Möglichkeit, das Wischmodul und den angehängten Wischlappen anzuheben. Dies schont Teppiche und verhindert, dass der Roboter den Schmutz im Wischtuch im Raum verteilt. Mit der Einführung des Roborock S7 wurde diese Wischtechnik eingeführt und ist auch bei den aktuellen Modellen Roborock S8 und Roborock S8 Pro Ultra verfügbar. Zoom Saubermann: Auf der rechten Seite des Bildes strahlen die Fliesen bereits, während auf der linken Seite noch gereinigt werden muss. Dreame (im Bild) überzeugt beim Wischen und saugt fast genauso effektiv wie die teureren Modelle von Ecovacs und Roborock. Bild: Dreame, AUTO BILD Bei der Nassreinigung setzen Ecovacs, Dreame und Yeedi in ihren aktuellen Modellen nicht mehr ausschließlich auf einen Wischlappen. Stattdessen kommen jeweils zwei runde Wischpads zum Einsatz, die magnetisch am unteren Teil des Geräts haften. Dank ihrer Fransen nehmen sie effizient Wasser auf und rotieren mit etwas Druck über den Boden. Im Test zahlte sich dies aus: Dort, wo andere Sauger zu zögerlich und trocken wischten, sorgten diese Modelle bei Parkett und Laminat nach dem Schrubben für beeindruckenden Glanz. Auf dunklen Fliesen hinterließen Dreame und Ecovacs leichte, während der Yeedi deutliche Schlieren zeigte. Dies führte dazu, dass sehr hartnäckiger Schmutz und leicht angetrocknete Flecken nach ein bis zwei Reinigungsdurchgängen zwar entfernt waren, der Boden jedoch nicht immer makellos aussah. Beim Reinigen wurde ausschließlich Leitungswasser verwendet. Lediglich der Dreame L10s Ultra verfügt in seiner Station über einen schmalen Behälter, der dem Wischwasser Reinigungsmittel zuführt. Bei den anderen Geräten können Putzmittel im Tank die Reinigungsleistung verbessern. Welche Mittel sich eignen und wie Sie Kalkablagerungen vermeiden können, erfahren Sie weiter unten. Positiv zu vermerken ist, dass die meisten Roboter automatisch Teppichböden erkennen und diese beim Wischen aussparen. Im Test verhakte sich jedoch ein Wischpad des Dreame unter der Teppichkante, koppelte sich ab und unterbrach so die Reinigung. Die Geräte der Roborock S7- und aktuellen S8-Serien setzen auf die klassische Methode: Sie verwenden einen Lappen, der an einer beweglichen Wischplatte befestigt ist und mit Schallvibrationen sowie Schwenkbewegungen über den Boden schrubbt. Diese Methode entfernt die meisten Flecken, sofern sie nicht zu hartnäckig oder angetrocknet sind. Die Roborock-Lösung passt gut zum Konzept des autonomen Putzens, da die ""Vibra Rise""-Technik die Wischplatte automatisch anhebt und den Wasserfluss stoppt, sobald sich das Gerät einem Teppich nähert. Dieses präzise und nahtlose Vorgehen ist ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal von Roborock auf Putzmission! Bei Ecovacs, Dreame und Yeedi müssen Benutzer zunächst die Wischpads oder Wischmodule abklemmen, bevor die Roboter in Räumen mit Teppich oder anderer empfindlicher Auslegeware ihre Reinigung starten können. Wie funktioniert die autonome Reinigung? Das Geheimnis des automatischen Putzens liegt weniger in den Putzrobotern selbst als vielmehr in den mitgelieferten Dockingstationen. Diese haben etwa die Größe eines großen Weinkartons und beanspruchen dementsprechend Platz. Doch dafür unterstützen sie den Roboter bei der Arbeit auf verschiedene Weisen: Wischwasser nachfüllen Viele Docks sind mit einem Wassertank ausgestattet. Der Benutzer füllt diesen unter dem Wasserhahn mit Frischwasser auf. Je nach Modell passen dort etwa 3 Liter ( Roborock S8 Pro Ultra, Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, Roborock S7 Pro Ultra und Dreame L10s Ultra) bis gut 4 Liter ( Ecovacs Deebot X1 Omni und Dreame W10) hinein. Die Station pumpt regelmäßig Nachschub in den kleinen Tank des Roboters, damit ihm beim Wischen nie das Wasser ausgeht. Bei Roborock und der Yeedi Mop Station lässt sich der Tank herausnehmen und direkt befüllen. Bei Ecovacs ist der Tank fest eingebaut – nur das Dock kann dort Wasser hinzufügen. Beim Dreame W10 hat der Roboter überhaupt kein Wasser an Bord. Der Trick: Vor dem Wischen befeuchtet das Gerät seine runden Pads direkt in der Dockingstation – und kehrt dorthin regelmäßig zurück, um sie erneut zu befeuchten. Auf Wunsch geschieht dies alle 5, 10 oder 15 Quadratmeter oder auch nach jedem gereinigten Raum. Zoom Die Docks (im Bild: Ecovacs) bieten zahlreiche Funktionen: Aufladen des Roboters, Reinigen der Wischmopps, Entleeren der Staubbox, Aufbewahren des Dreckwassers, Nachfüllen von frischem Wischwasser. Bild: Ecovacs Wischer reinigen und trocknen Das Frischwasser hat eine weitere wichtige Funktion. Das Dock reinigt damit vollautomatisch den verschmutzten Wischmopp, um sicherzustellen, dass dieser nicht schimmelt oder Schmutz und Bakterien vom Bad ins Wohnzimmer trägt. In den Parkflächen der Stationen ist immer eine kleine Mini-Waschanlage eingebaut. Bei Ecovacs, Dreame und Yeedi rotieren die Wischer über geriffelte Erhebungen und spülen die Zotteln mit viel Wasser durch. Das dauert knapp zwei Minuten – inklusive intensivem Kratzen und Blubbern. Clever: Damit die Wischer nach der Putztour nicht müffeln oder gar schimmeln, ist im Dock ein Gebläse eingebaut. Das föhnt die feuchten Pads trocken. Dank heißer Luft gelingt dies am besten bei Ecovacs und Dreame. Der Vorgang dauert drei bis fünf Stunden, ist jedoch nur durch ein leises, kaum störendes Surren bemerkbar. Bei Yeedi wirkt die Funktion lieblos: Das Gebläse nutzt nur kalte Luft, ist deutlich hörbar, und selbst nach sechs Stunden sind die Wischer noch feucht. Kaum nachhaltig: Wer die Wischer in die Waschmaschine stecken oder austauschen möchte, schaut bei Dreame und Yeedi in die Röhre. Die Wischmopps sind fest mit den rotierenden Pads vernäht. Besser macht das Ecovacs: Der Hersteller nutzt Klettverschlüsse und liefert sogar Ersatz mit. Roborock verzichtet ganz auf aktives Trocknen, hebt aber immerhin seine Wischplatte an, damit der Lappen an der Luft trocknen kann. Gut: Bei der Mopp-Reinigung kommt hier eine kleine rotierende, fast tanzende Bürste im Dock zum Einsatz, die das Wischtuch kräftig durchschrubbt. So sah es auch nach Wochen fast aus wie neu. Dreckwasser sammeln Die Docks der Premium-Putzer von Roborock, Ecovacs, Dreame und Yeedi verfügen über einen zweiten Wasserbehälter gleicher Größe. In diesem sammelt sich das Schmutzwasser, das bei der Mopp-Reinigung entsteht. Bevor der Tank überläuft, warnen die Apps der Hersteller und stoppen die Reinigung. Alle Wasserbehälter sind gut abgedichtet, um sicherzustellen, dass kein muffiger Geruch nach außen dringt. Der Wasserbehälter kann einfach am Tragegriff gepackt und das Dreckwasser in Spüle oder Toilette entsorgt werden. Zoom Das ist praktisch! Schmutzwasser wird im Abwassertank aufgefangen (rechts), der je nach Modell 3 bis 5 Liter fasst (im Bild: Yeedi). Bild: Yeedi, AUTO BILD Staub saugen Die ""einfachen"" Docks, bei Ecovacs und Roborock immer mit einem ""Plus"" oder ""+"" bezeichnet, kümmern sich aufgrund des fehlenden Wassertanks nicht um das Wassermanagement des Roboters. Stattdessen verfügen sie ausschließlich über eine Absaugfunktion. Die Station saugt regelmäßig die kleine Staubbox leer, in der die Putzhilfe Krümel und Wollmäuse nach Hause bringt. Die Beute landet entweder in einem extragroßen Behälter oder in einem darin hängenden Staubbeutel. Hier müssen sich Nutzerinnen und Nutzer tage- oder wochenlang nicht um das Entleeren kümmern. Nur die teuren Premium-Modelle von Roborock und Ecovacs bieten diese Absaugfunktion zusätzlich zur smarten Wasserversorgung. Auch das beste Dock nutzt wenig, wenn der Roboter nicht clever ist. In dieser Preisklasse ist smartes Navigieren Pflicht. Dazu sitzt in der Regel oben auf dem Robo ein kleiner ""Aussichtsturm"" samt Laser, der weit in die Räume guckt und bei der Orientierung hilft. Der günstige Yeedi setzt beim Navigieren auf eine Kamera. Schon beim ersten Kennenlernen der Wohnung kostete das Nerven. Wo die Konkurrenz jeden Raum kurz begutachtete und nach maximal fünf Minuten fertig war, nahm sich der Yeedi knappe zwei Stunden Zeit für die Proberunde. Die Putzarbeiten lassen sich in den jeweiligen Handy-Apps kontrollieren. Die darin angelegte virtuelle Karte zeigt Zimmer – und bei Roborock und Ecovacs sogar Möbel. Im Grundriss lassen sich detailverliebt Räume benennen, weitere Möbel platzieren sowie Bodenbeläge, Sperrbereiche und Reinigungspläne festlegen. Für den Schnellzugriff können Sie einzelne Putzprogramme zusammenstellen. Dann genügt künftig ein Fingertipp, und der Roboter saugt und wischt – etwa nach dem Frühstück den Bereich um den Esstisch mit der gewünschten Saugstärke und Wassermenge. Zoom In den Smartphone-Apps können Nutzer eine virtuelle Karte der Räume anzeigen, Putzprogramme starten oder, wie bei Roborock (im Bild), Hindernisse entdecken, die von der Kamera erkannt wurden. Bild: Roborock, COMPUTERBILD Ohne Smartphone lässt sich die Steuerung per Sprachbefehl realisieren. Der Sauger kann auf Zuruf mit Amazon Alexa und dem Google Assistant gestartet werden. Falls zu Hause kein Smart Speaker vorhanden ist, kann man sich direkt an den Ecovacs Deebot X1 wenden. Hier ist mit Yiko ein eigener Sprachassistent integriert. In ersten Tests zeigte sich, dass Yiko noch etwas lernbedürftig ist – eine echte Herausforderung für etablierte Sprachassistenten wie Alexa. Im Saugtest mussten alle Kandidaten zeigen, wie effektiv sie Staub und Schmutz aufnehmen können. Die Tester verteilten Katzenstreu, Müsli und Holzspäne auf Teppich- und Laminatboden. Ein Gemisch von 100 Gramm lag bereit, um von den Robotern aufgesaugt zu werden. Das Ergebnis: Der Yeedi saugte mit knapp 84 Gramm am wenigsten auf. Die Konkurrenten schafften mindestens 10 Gramm mehr. Die Premiumsauger von Roborock, Dreame und Ecovacs erwiesen sich als besonders leistungsfähig. Deren Gummirollen durchkämmten sogar den Flokati gründlich und holten viel Dreck aus den Fasern. Dreame leistete hier ebenfalls gute Arbeit. Im Gegensatz dazu blieb der Yeedi oft im Teppich stecken und verweigerte dann seinen Putzdienst. Die smarten Helfer kümmerten sich in der Regel gewissenhaft um Kanten, Ecken und Tischbeine. Praktischerweise passen viele Modelle die Saugleistung automatisch an den Untergrund an – kräftiger auf tiefem Teppichboden und zurückhaltender auf glattem Belag. Dank der Absaugfunktion gaben Roborock, Ecovacs und der Dreame L10s Ultra beim Saugen erst nach ein paar Wochen nach. Der Dreame W10 und Yeedi benötigten deutlich früher menschliche Hilfe: Ihre kleinen Staubbehälter waren schnell gefüllt und ließen sich nicht entleeren, während der Roboter geparkt war! Um dies zu tun, musste das Gerät oder gleich die gesamte Parkstation aus dem Dock gezogen werden. Daher tendierten die Tester dazu, den Sauger unterwegs abzufangen und die Staubbox vor dem Parken zu reinigen. Die Extras: Kameras und Hinderniserkennung Die Roboter können zwar keine unordentliche Wohnung aufräumen, aber die teuren Geräte von Roborock, Dreame und Ecovacs lassen sich von Chaos nicht aus dem Konzept bringen. Eingebaute Kameras und Sensoren überwachen die Putzfahrt ""vorausschauend"". Dies schonte im Test die schlafende Katze, die teure Bodenvase oder herumliegende Gegenstände. Die Geräte saugten oder stießen diese in der Regel nicht an, sondern umschifften sie geschickt. Zusätzlich gab es in der Karte für jedes störende Objekt eine Markierung plus Foto, damit der Hausherr vor der nächsten Putztour Ordnung schaffen kann. Der Roborock S7 MaxV kann bei Bedarf sogar ein helles Licht einschalten, damit er nie im Dunkeln tappt. Doch es geht noch weiter: Da sich Mikrofone und Lautsprecher zur Kamera gesellen, eignet er sich sogar für Video-Chats. Wer möchte, kann den Roboter per App durch die Räume steuern und beispielsweise den Hund lautstark vom Sofa scheuchen oder die aufmüpfigen Kinder ins Bett schicken. Auf die Tester wirkte die rollende Überwachung jedoch ziemlich befremdlich. Immerhin wird diese Funktion erst durch Drücken der drei Tasten am Gerät aktiviert. Sie ist mit einem Sperrcode gesichert und macht per Sprachansage wiederholt auf sich aufmerksam. Es geht auch preiswerter: Wischroboter bis 400 Euro Wer nicht sofort ein kleines Vermögen für die intelligente Nassreinigung ausgeben möchte, kann auf preiswertere Wischroboter ohne Dockingstation zurückgreifen. Zum Beispiel lässt sich dem Ecovacs Deebot T9 für knapp 400 Euro ein effektives Wischen bescheinigen, das viele Flecken, wenn auch nicht alle, beseitigt. Im Test führte das "" Ozmo""-Wischen zu besseren Reinigungsergebnissen im Vergleich zu anderen Saugern, die das Wischtuch nur nachlässig und mit wenig Druck hinter sich herzogen. Noch kostengünstiger und ein kleiner Geheimtipp ist der Yeedi Vac 2 Pro. Der Preis für diesen Schnäppchen-Sauger mit einer soliden Wischfunktion beträgt 280 Euro (Stand zum Testzeitpunkt). Unser Fazit zum Wischroboter-Test Viel aufsaugen, kräftig wischen, ­clever navigieren – solche Putz­talente sind in dieser Preisklasse Pflicht. Richtig smart und selbstständig werden die Sauger erst dank Absaug- und Docking­station, die sich automatisch um den Staub und die Wischmopps – oder sogar um beides – kümmert. Das autonome Reinigen gelingt dem Roborock S8 Pro Ultra am besten. Er kostete zum Testzeitpunkt rund 1.379 Euro. Wen der hohe Preis abschreckt: Die Modelle Dreame Bot W10 und Ecovacs Deebot T9 um 500 Euro machen ebenfalls ­einen guten Putzjob.

Kindersitz aber mit Sicherheit: Gruppe 2/3 (9-36kg) im Test,"Wir testen Kindersitze der Gruppe 2/3 und bewerten Sicherheit, Komfort und Handhabung, um Ihnen die besten Modelle vorstellen zu können.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/kindersitze-gruppe-2-3-test-21305909.html,,2024-11-21 05:00:00,AUTO BILD,,"Bei Gruppe 2/3 ist das Gewicht entscheidend Anders als bei i-Size-Sitzen gibt es für die Kindersitz-Gruppe 2/3 keine Angaben zur zulässigen Körpergröße, sondern nur zum zulässigen Gewicht. Trotzdem sollte auch bei einem Gruppe-2/3-Sitz vor dem Kauf mit einem Probesitzen geklärt werden, ob das Kind gut in den Sitz passt. Um dem Wachstum des Kindes gerecht zu werden, sind Gruppe-2/3-Kindersitze an der Kopfstütze in der Größe verstellbar. Zwischen der Kopfstütze des Gruppe-2/3-Sitzes und der Schulter des Kindes sollte ziemlich genau zwei Finger breit Platz sein. Die Kopfstütze ist durch einen Hebel – in der Regel an der Rückseite des Sitzes – in der Größe verstellbar, sodass der Sitz der Kindesgröße angepasst werden kann. Die Einstellung der Kopfstütze sollte mit jedem Zentimeter, den das Kind gewachsen ist, nachjustiert werden. Eine Breitenverstellung erhöht die Variabilität Einige Gruppe-2/3-Sitze sind nicht nur in der Höhe, sondern auch in der Breite verstellbar. Die Breitenverstellung erfolgt entweder automatisch mit der Höhenverstellung (z.B. Cybex Solution Z-Fix) oder durch bewegliche Sitzwangen, die in die Breite nachgeben (z.B. Maxi-Cosi RodiFix Air Protect). Bei anderen Sitzen laufen wiederum die Sitzwangen V-förmig zu, sodass sie für größere Kinder in der Breite mehr Platz bieten als für kleinere Kinder (z.B. Britax Römer Kidfix III M). Egal ob mit Breitenverstellung oder ohne: Je nach Statur des Kindes sollte der Sitz innen an den oberen Kanten der Seitenwangen mindestens 40 Zentimeter Platz für die Schultern bieten, ansonsten könnte sich das Kind mit der Zeit eingeengt fühlen. Auch Kindersitze der Gruppe 1/2/3 gehören zu den sogenannten ""mitwachsenden Kindersitzen"". Sie können sogar schon direkt nach der Babyschale folgen. Allerdings geht die lange Einsetzbarkeit zu Lasten der optimalen Passform. Gruppe-2/3-Sitze werden immer vorwärtsgerichtet ins Auto montiert. Auf welchem Platz der Sitz am besten positioniert wird, ist der Anleitung zu entnehmen. In der Regel ist die sicherste Position die Mitte der Rückbank. Da hier eine Positionierung aber oft nicht zulässig ist (z.B. aufgrund des fehlenden Dreipunkt-Gurtes), fällt die Wahl meist auf den Platz hinter dem Beifahrersitz, da die Fahrerseite statistisch gesehen häufiger von einem Unfall betroffen ist, als die Beifahrerseite. Das Kind wird mit dem Auto-Gurt gesichert Gruppe-2/3-Sitze haben kein eigenes Gurt-System; die Kinder werden mit dem Dreipunkt-Gurt des Fahrzeugs gesichert. Deswegen ist es wichtig auf einen guten Gurtverlauf zu achten. Dafür haben die Sitze zum einen Gurtführungs-Punkte unterhalb der Kopfstütze sowie Führungshörner an der Sitzerhöhung. Dort muss der Gurt eingefädelt werden. Meist befinden sich an den Sitzen Aufkleber mit Sicherheitshinweisen, die den richtigen Einsatz des Gurtes erklären. Für einen optimalen Gurtverlauf am Oberkörper muss die Kopfstütze richtig eingestellt sein. Beim Gurtverlauf am Becken ist darauf zu achten, dass der Gurt über den Beckenknochen liegt und nicht hochrutschen kann. Sitzt der Gurt hier nicht optimal, sondern verrutscht nach oben, kann das bei einem Frontalaufprall Verletzungen im Bauchraum nach sich ziehen. Um sicherzugehen, dass der Gurt auch während der Fahrt in seiner Führung bleibt, sollte der Sitz einmal im Auto mit dem Kind ausprobiert werden. Am besten bittet man das Kind, sich etwas zu bewegen: Dabei darf sich der Gurtverlauf nicht verändern, außerdem sollte sich der Sicherheitsgurt nicht verdrehen oder in der Gurtführung hängenbleiben – geschweige denn herausrutschen. Unbedingt auf die Kopfstütze achten Des Weiteren ist beim Gruppe-2/3-Sitz darauf zu achten, dass der Kopf des Kindes in der Kopfstütze eine bequeme Position hat und nicht nach vorne fallen kann. Denn beim Schlafen neigen insbesondere jüngere Kinder dazu, mit dem Oberkörper nach vorne zu kippen. Ist das der Fall, befindet sich der Kopf nicht mehr im geschützten Bereich der Kopfstütze – bei einem Seitenaufprall kann das zu schweren Verletzungen führen. Deswegen greift man idealerweise auf einen Sitz mit Neigungsverstellung oder speziell konstruierter Kopfstütze (z.B. gb Elian Fix) zurück. Der Sitz selbst wird entweder mit dem Fahrzeuggurt oder per Isofix befestigt. Durch die Isofix-Befestigung steht der Sitz besonders fest und stabil im Fahrzeug. Wer ein Auto mit entsprechenden Isofix-Annahmepunkten hat, sollte deswegen auf den Gruppe-2/3-Sitz mit Isofix-Armen zurückgreifen. Anders als Babyschalen oder Gruppe-1-Sitze, die für Isofix-Nutzung in der Regel eine gesonderte Basis benötigen, sind die Isofix-Arme beim Gruppe-2/3-Sitz integriert und lassen sich einfach rausklappen oder -ziehen. Soll der Sitz doch einmal in einem Auto ohne Isofix genutzt werden, können die Arme eingeklappt und der Sitz mit dem Fahrzeuggurt gesichert werden. Seitenprotektoren bieten zusätzlichen Schutz Viele Sitze bieten darüber hinaus weitere Features. Besonders sinnvoll sind dabei zusätzliche Seitenprotektoren, die bei einem Seitenaufprall zusätzlichen Schutz bieten. Einige Kindersitze bieten zudem individuelle Ausstattungsmerkmale wie Luftkissen in der Kopfstütze oder integrierte Lautsprecher (z.B. Recaro Monza Nova 2). Da ein Kindersitz der Gruppe 2/3 im besten Fall über acht Jahre genutzt wird, ist es umso wichtiger, dass sich das Kind darin wohlfühlt. Auch in diesem Punkt ist ein Probesitzen wieder unerlässlich. Idealerweise schränken die Seitenwangen an der Kopfstütze die Sicht des Kindes nicht zu sehr ein; die Beinauflagefläche sollte breit genug sein. Auch eine bequeme Polsterung ist wichtig, und damit das Kind im Sitz nicht schwitzt, sollte auf ein Belüftungssystem (Aussparungen in Sitzfläche und -lehne) sowie atmungsaktive Stoffe geachtet werden. Außerdem kann es ein Vorteil sein, wenn sich die Bezüge leicht entfernen lassen. In der Regel sind sie bei 30 Grad im Feinwaschprogramm der Maschine waschbar.

"Gebrauchte Citroën-Modelle: Daten, Fakten, Kauftipps",Die Stellantis-Marke Citroën bietet bezahlbare Autos mit dem gewissen Etwas. Doch wie steht es beim Secondhand-Kauf um die Qualität? Hier kommt der AUTO BILD-Check!,https://www.autobild.de/artikel/citroen-gebraucht-kaufen-18420437.html,,2024-11-21 05:00:00,Lars Jakumeit,,"Extravagant und komfortabel. Aber auch divenhaft. So ist das Image der Traditionsmarke Citroën in Deutschland. Die Franzosen schrieben vor Jahrzehnten unter anderem Geschichte mit Modellen wie dem genial einfachen 2 CV und Innovationsträgern wie den hydropneumatisch gefederten Modellen DS, BX, CX und XM. Durch die PSA-Konzern-Ehe mit Peugeot und die spätere Integration in den Stellantis-Konzern wurden die Fahrzeuge Schritt für Schritt technisch konventioneller, aber nicht langweilig. Spezialitäten sind hierzulande clever konstruierte Klein- und Kompaktwagen sowie vergleichsweise moderat dimensionierte Aircross-SUV-Modelle. Relativ beliebt, weil besonders geräumig und nicht allzu teuer, sind außerdem die SpaceTourer-Modelle. 2023 verkündete Citroën gegen den Branchentrend und von der jeweiligen Kostenstruktur abhängige Preissenkungen von bis zu 6000 Euro für einzelne Modelle. Damit wollte die Marke ihr Image als Anbieter bezahlbarer Mobilität schärfen, sich attraktiver positionieren und gleichzeitig mit Fixpreisen die bisher nicht unüblichen Rabattschlachten zwischen Händlern verhindern. Gleichzeitig sortiert der in Rüsselsheim ansässige Importeur sein Vetriebs- und Servicenetz neu, setzt verstärkt auf seine Stellantis-&-You-Mehrmarkenautohäuser. Und die Autos? Bis 2023 waren die Ausstattungslinien Live, Feel, Feel Pack, Shine und Shine Pack üblich. Danach folgte eine Umstellung auf You, Plus und Max. Und wie steht es um die Langzeitqualitäten? Die Ergebnisse im TÜV-Report sind mittelmäßig bis schwach, was jedoch häufig auch an mangelhaften Wartungshistorien älterer Modelle liegt. Im AUTO BILD-Dauertest zeigte sich Citroën arg durchwachsen: Ein C5 vollendete die 100.000 Kilometer mit der Endnote 2. Ein C4 Cactus patzte dagegen mit Rostansätzen und machanischen Problemen. Für ihn reichte es 2017 trotz des sympathischen Konzepts nach 100.000 Kilometern nur für die Endnote 4+. Und in Zukunft? Nachdem sich der Absatz der Marke in weniger als 15 Jahren von 1 ,5 Millionen auf 800.000 Einheiten reduziert hat, soll der Marktanteil in Europa zukünftig von vier auf fünf Prozent steigen. Was grundsätzlich nicht unrealistisch sein muss. Citroën will in Zukunft mit bezahlbarer elektrischer Mobilität und Stellantis-Baukastentechnik punkten. Der neue ë-C3, ë-C4 X und Ami sind Vorboten dieser neuen Ära. Im folgenden unsere Tipps zu den wichtigsten Modellen am Gebrauchtwagenmarkt: Citroën C1 Neupreise: von 10.090 bis 15.800 Euro • Gebrauchtpreise: von 4400 bis 13.890 Euro • Durchschn. Gebrauchtpreis: 8498 Euro • Motoren: von 68 bis 82 PS • Motortipp: 82 PS, 5,7 l S/100 km • Rückrufe: 6 • Euro-NCAP-Insassenschutz: 68 % ( 3 Sterne, 2012). Gefällt uns Günstiger Unterhalt Günstiger Unterhalt Tolle Handlichkeit Gefällt uns nicht Platzangebot limitiert Platzangebot limitiert Basisausstattung arg nackt Klein und charmant ist der Einstieg in die Citroën-Markenwelt. Die erste Generation des C1 wurde bis 2014 im tschechischen Kolín montiert und passt eher anspruchslosen Naturen: Schleuderschutz ESP und Klimaanlage kosteten extra. Das Gros der angebotenen Billig-Exemplare hat bereits seine Karriere hinter sich, wurde im Alltag verschlissen. Solider ist der zusammen mit Peugeot und Toyota entwickelte zweite C1. Er lief bis 2022 vom Band und ist spürbar moderner und erwachsener. Zoom Der C1 ist das klassische Stadt- und Anfängerauto. Bild: Toni Bader Ob mit 68 oder 82 PS, der C1 ist ein klassisches Stadt- und Anfängerauto. Für Fahrspaß sorgen das optionale Airscape-Faltverdeck und ein besseres Infotainment. Der zweite C1 sollte Großstädter mit 9,60 Meter Wendekreis begeistern. Abgasanlage und Bremse sind problematisch. Citroën C3 Neupreise: von 12.800 bis 27.800 Euro • Gebrauchtpreise: von 5995 bis 17.370 Euro • Durchschn. Gebrauchtpreis: 13.493 Euro • Motoren: von 60 bis 120 PS • Motortipp: 110 PS, 6,5 l S/100 km • Rückrufe: 34 • Euro-NCAP-Insassenschutz: 88 % (4 Sterne, 2017). Gefällt uns Gutes Raumangebot Gutes Raumangebot Charmante Details Gefällt uns nicht Etliche Rückrufe Etliche Rückrufe Qualitätsdefizite im Detail Der C3 II ging von 2009 bis 2017 auf Kundenfang. Breit ist das Motorenspektrum von 60 bis 120 PS. Gut gefallen der Fahrkomfort, das Raumangebot und Details wie eine optionale Panoramafrontscheibe. Im TÜV-Report schneidet diese C3-Generation jedoch unterdurchschnittlich ab. Verschlissene Fahrwerke, rottige Abgasanlagen und Ölverluste bereiten den Prüfern Sorgen. Zoom Am C3 gefallen der Fahrkomfort, das Raumangebot und Details wie eine optionale Panoramafrontscheibe. Bild: Toni Bader Der im Frühjahr 2017 eingeführte C3 III setzt wie sein großer Bruder auf Airbump-Luftpolster und Farbakzente. Der Innenraum wirkt jedoch recht preissensibel gestaltet. Den Antrieb übernimmt ein 1,2-Liter-Dreizylinder-Benziner mit 68, 82 oder 110 PS. Vergleichsweise groß ist die Dieselauswahl, sie sind 75, 99 oder 102 PS stark. Die Bilanz trüben diverse Rückrufe, unter anderem wegen erhöhter NOx-Werte, Problemen mit dem Partikelfilter, nicht korrekt befestigter Klimakompressoren. DS3 Neupreise: von 15.490 bis 31.210 Euro • Gebrauchtpreise: von 6950 bis 25.490 Euro • Durchschn. Gebrauchtpreis: 8499 Euro • Motoren: von 70 bis 207 PS • Motortipp: 120 PS, 6,9 l S/100 km • Rückrufe: 10 • Euro-NCAP-Insassenschutz: 87 % (5 Sterne, 2009). Gefällt uns Angenehmes Raumgefühl Angenehmes Raumgefühl Gutes Fahrwerk Gefällt uns nicht Teurer Unterhalt Teurer Unterhalt Kritischer THP-Motor Der DS3 ist technisch vom C3 abgeleitet und wurde bis 2015 noch als Citroën-Modell vermarktet. Der französische Mini-Konkurrent bietet eine edle Ausstattung und vermittelt je nach Motorisierung reichlich Fahrspaß. Besonders groß sind die Individualisierungsmöglichkeiten. Das 2013 nachgereichte Cabriolet mit Stoff-Faltdach von Webasto spricht Frischluftfans an. Zoom Anfangs wurden die DS-Modelle (im Bild der DS3 als Cabrio) noch als Citroën vermarktet. Bild: Ronald Sassen Neben Benzinern und – typisch Franzosen – diversen Dieseln gab es auch einen Mikro-Hybrid-Diesel und eine LPG-Variante. Vorsicht ist beim THP-16V-Motor angebracht. Dieser wirkt in dem kleinen Auto enorm kräftig, zeigt jedoch häufig Steuerkettenprobleme und Ölverbrauch. Auch Benzinpumpen und Turbos halten nicht ewig. Die Diesel leiden häufiger unter Kurzstreckenbetrieb, können Ölverdünnung zeigen. Citroën C4 Neupreise: von 16.970 bis 34.490 Euro • Gebrauchtpreise: von 5995 bis 31.990 Euro • Durchschn. Gebrauchtpreis: 19.985 Euro • Motoren: von 92 bis 155 PS • Motortipp: 130 PS, 6,8 l S/100 km • Rückrufe: 60 • Euro-NCAP-Insassenschutz: 90 % (5 Sterne, 2010). Gefällt uns Viel Platz Viel Platz Große Motorenauswahl Gefällt uns nicht Hohe Mängelquoten im Alter Hohe Mängelquoten im Alter Kritischer THP-Motor Die von 2010 bis 2018 gebaute zweite Generation des Kompaktklässlers ist stets ein fünftüriger Raumriese. Die Ausstattungen Attraction, Tendance und Exclusive decken die volle Bandbreite von frugal bis nobel ab. 2015 hat Citroën das Modell umfangreich modernisiert: Ein Sieben-Zoll-Touchscreen und Optionen wie ein Keyless-System wurden nachgereicht. Zoom C4: Vielfahrer haben eine Auswahl an gut gemachten HDi-Dieselmotoren. Bild: Roman Raetzke Als Antriebe gibt es diverse Benziner und Diesel von 92 bis 155 PS. Standfest sind die VTi-Saugbenziner, erfreulich modern die Pure-Tech-Triebwerke. Vielfahrer dürfte die Auswahl an gut gemachten HDi-Dieselmotoren erfreuen. Wirklich kritisch ist nur der THP-Turbobenziner. Unharmonisch arbeitet außerdem das optionale automatisierte Schaltgetriebe. Probleme machen die Bremsanlage, verrottete Abgasanlagen und Ölverlust. Auch in der TÜV- und Pannenstatistik war der C4 alles andere als fehlerfrei. Citroën C4 Cactus Neupreise: von 13.990 bis 26.540 Euro • Gebrauchtpreise: von 9700 bis 15.490 Euro • Durchschn. Gebrauchtpreis: 11.900 Euro • Motoren: von 75 bis 131 PS • Motortipp: 110 PS, 6,0 l S/100 km • Rückrufe: 14 • Euro-NCAP-Insassenschutz: 82 % (4 Sterne, 2014).

Platz und Charme sind für Sympathien gut, auf Dauer zählt jedoch Qualität. Markante Airbumps in den Türen sollen Rempler bis 3 km/h egalisieren. Im Alltag können Schrullen wie die arg weichen Sitze und grobe Verarbeitungsmängel nerven. Die Basisausstattung ist zu minimalistisch.

Besser fährt der 110-PS-Turbo. Im Dauertest kassierte ein C4 Cactus 2017 nach bewegten 100.000 Kilometern die schwache Endnote 4+. Die von 2018 bis 2020 gebaute zweite Generation war eigentlich nur ein umfangreiches Facelift. Citroën C5 Neupreise: von 22.640 bis 43.340 Euro • Gebrauchtpreise: von 6600 bis 11.990 Euro • Durchschn. Gebrauchtpreis: 9799 Euro • Motoren: von 109 bis 240 PS • Motortipp: 180 PS, 6,6 l D/100 km • Rückrufe: 25 • Euro-NCAP-Insassenschutz: 81 % (5 Sterne, 2009).

Welche Schadenfreiheitsklassen gibt es?,Unfallfreies Fahren wird von den Kfz-Versicherungen durch eine günstige Schadenfreiheitsklasse und einen hohen Schadenfreiheitsrabatt belohnt. Wie das System funktioniert und was dabei zu beachten ist.,https://www.autobild.de/artikel/schadenfreiheitsklasse-und-schadenfreiheitsrabatt-in-der-kfz-versicherung-36479.html,,2024-11-21 05:00:00,Daniel Ewen,,"Die Schadenfreiheitsklasse (kurz SF-Klasse) gibt an, wie viele Jahre ein Versicherter unfallfrei gefahren ist, beziehungsweise keinen Schaden über die Kfz-Versicherung reguliert hat. Je höher die Schadenfreiheitsklasse, desto höher der Schadenfreiheitsrabatt, den die Versicherung auf den zu zahlenden Grundbeitrag anrechnet. Schadenfreiheitsklassen reichen von 0 (Ersteinstufung für Fahranfänger mit weniger als drei Jahren Fahrerlaubnis ) bis 35 (35 Jahre oder mehr ohne Schaden). Darüber hinaus gibt es noch die Schadenfreiheitsklassen 1/2, S und M. SF-Klasse 1/2 ist für Fahrer vorgesehen, die erstmalig selber ein Auto versichern, aber schon nachweisbar über Fahrpraxis verfügen (zum Beispiel, wenn sie als weiterer Fahrer im Vertrag eines anderen Versicherungsnehmers eingetragen waren). KFZ-VERSICHERUNGSVERGLEICH Über 330 Autoversicherungen im Vergleich Vergleichen Sie kostenlos und schließen Sie Ihre Kfz-Versicherung direkt online ab. Zum Angebot In Kooperation mit In SF-Klasse M (Malus-Klasse) werden Fahrer zurückgestuft, die als Fahranfänger bereits kurz nach Abschluss der Versicherung einen Schaden verursachen. In SF-Klasse S (Schadenklasse) werden Fahrer aus der SF-Klasse 1 zurückgestuft, wenn sie einen Unfall verursachen. Der Aufbau der SF-Klassen ist bei allen Versicherungen gleich. Allerdings kann sich der Schadenfreiheitsrabatt, der einer SF-Klasse zugeordnet ist, von Versicherung zu Versicherung unterscheiden (in der Tabelle unten zeigen wir ein Beispiel der HUK-Coburg). Wie das System der Schadenfreiheitsklassen funktioniert Die Versicherungen überprüfen regelmäßig am Jahresende, ob der Versicherte einen Schaden gemeldet hat. Wer im abgelaufenen Jahr ohne Unfall blieb, steigt eine Klasse auf. Voraussetzung: Der Vertrag muss in dem betrachteten Jahr mindestens sechs Monate bestanden haben. Wer also erst im August die erste Autoversicherung abschließt, steigt erst nach Ablauf des folgenden Jahres in die nächsthöhere SF-Klasse auf. Mit dem Aufstieg in die höhere Beitragsklasse verringert sich dann auch der Beitragssatz. Allerdings nur dann, wenn der höheren SF-Klasse auch ein höherer Schadenfreiheitsrabatt zugeordnet ist. In einigen Fällen kann der Rabatt nämlich auch über mehrere SF-Klassen gleich bleiben (siehe zum Beispiel in der Tabelle unten SF-Klassen 30 bis 32). Schadenfreiheitsklassen kommen sowohl bei der Kfz-Haftpflicht - als auch bei Vollkaskoversicherungen zur Anwendung. Bei der Teilkaskoversicherung gibt es keine SF-Klasse, weil die Teilkasko nur bei Schäden greift, die der Versicherte nicht selbst verursacht hat. Er hat folglich selber keinen Einfluss darauf, ob er ohne Schaden bleibt oder nicht. Das Fehlen von SF-Klassen in der Teilkasko führt dazu, dass eine Vollkaskoversicherung in manchen Fällen günstiger ist als eine Teilkasko. Dann nämlich, wenn der Versicherte in der Vollkasko bereits eine hohe Schadenfreiheitsklasse erreicht hat. Wer aus Kostengründen bei einem älteren Fahrzeug den Vollkaskoschutz auf Teilkasko reduzieren möchte, sollte also vorher mit einem Vergleichsrechner berechnen, ob eine Teilkaskoversicherung am Ende nicht sogar ungünstiger ausfallen würde.

Warum? Ist ein Schaden gemeldet worden und durch die Versicherung bezahlt worden, wird man normalerweise in der SF-Klasse zurückgestuft, dadurch wird der Versicherungsbeitrag teurer. Die Versicherung wird erst wieder günstiger, wenn man ein weiteres Jahr unfallfrei fährt. Zoom Bei einen selbstverschuldeten Schaden droht die Rückstufung in der SF-Klasse. Bild: DPA Dabei ist zu bedenken, dass die Rückstufung in der SF-Klasse auch für die folgenden Jahre einen höheren Versicherungsbeitrag im Vergleich zu der sonstigen Einstufung bedeuten kann. Was ist ein Rabattretter? Ältere Versicherungsverträge von vor 2012 enthalten mitunter noch einen Bestandteil, der sich Rabattretter nennt. Mit dem Rabattretter kann im Schadensfall eine Beitragserhöhung vermieden werden – jedoch nicht die Rückstufung in der SF-Klasse. Der Versicherungskunde verliert versicherungsfreie Jahre, wenn er einen Rabattretter in Anspruch nimmt, wird in der Schadenfreiheitsklasse aber nur so weit zurückgestuft, dass dies nicht zu einem höheren Beitrag führt. Ein Rabattretter kann in der Regel nur einmal pro Jahr in Anspruch genommen werden. Meldet der Versicherungsnehmer zwei Schadensfälle innerhalb von zwölf Monaten, führt der zweite Unfall zu einem höheren Beitrag. Der Rabattretter ist aber in der Regel Versicherten vorbehalten, die mindestens SF-Klasse 25 erreicht haben. Seit 2012 werden Rabattretter bei Neuverträgen in der Regel nicht mehr angeboten. Wer noch über einen alten Vertrag mit Rabattretter verfügt, sollte sich darüber bewusst sein, dass er diesen bei einem Versicherungswechsel verliert. Das gilt auch, wenn man bei demselben Anbieter nur den Tarif wechselt, um zum Beispiel auf einen günstigeren Neukundentarif umzusteigen. Unterschied zwischen Rabattretter und Rabattschutz Als Ersatz für den Rabattretter bieten heute viele Versicherungen einen sogenannten Rabattschutz an. Dieser verhindert, dass der Versicherungsnehmer nach einem Schadensfall zurückgestuft wird. Das tut der Rabattretter nicht. Auch der Rabattschutz greift nur für einen Schadensfall in einem bestimmten Zeitraum. Die meisten Anbieter gewähren den Kunden, sowohl den Rabattschutz als auch den Rabattretter nur einmal pro Jahr in Anspruch zu nehmen. Der Bund der Versicherten weist in seiner Rubrik ""Irrtümer"" noch auf eine Feinheit hin: ""Ist ein belastender Schaden angefallen, bleibt der Vertrag im folgenden Kalenderjahr zwar in der bisherigen SF-Klasse. Aber: Bei einem Wechsel der Versicherung, wird dem Nachversicherer der Schadenfreiheitsrabatt bestätigt, der ohne Rabattschutz erfahren wurde. Es wird somit eine Rückstufung des Schadenfreiheitsrabattes beim neuen Kfz-Versicherer vorgenommen!"" Anders als der Rabattretter ist der Rabattschutz auch keine freiwillige Leistung der Versicherung, sondern ein optionaler Bestandteil, der einen Aufschlag kostet. Das Übertragen von Schadenfreiheitsrabatten Viele Versicherer gestatten ihren Kunden, unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen den eigenen Schadenfreiheitsrabatt oder einen Teil davon zu übertragen : zum Beispiel auf die Kinder oder den Ehe-/Lebenspartner. Einige Versicherer lassen auch nicht leibliche Kinder oder die Enkel zu. Bedingung für den Übertrag ist meistens, dass der Empfänger das Auto mit den zu übertragenden SF-Klassen regelmäßig gefahren hat. Dieser Punkt ist aber auch nicht bei allen Versicherern eine zwingende Voraussetzung. Allerdings können nur so viele schadenfreie Jahre weitergegeben werden, wie der Empfänger seit Besitz seines Führerscheins bei einer eigenen Versicherung selbst hätte erhalten können. An einen Führerschein-Neuling kann folglich kein Schadenfreiheitsrabatt übertragen werden. Derjenige, der den Rabatt übertragen möchte, sollte sich darüber bewusst sein, dass er den einmal übertragenen Rabatt nicht mehr für sich selbst in Anspruch nehmen kann. Die Rabattübertragung kann zudem nicht wieder rückgängig gemacht werden. Unterbrechung des Versicherungsschutzes Wie lange alte Schadenfreiheitsrabatte anerkennt werden, legt jede Versicherung in den Allgemeinen Bedingungen für die Kfz-Versicherung (AKB) unter dem Punkt ""Wie wirkt sich eine Unterbrechung des Versicherungsschutzes auf den Schadenverlauf aus?"" fest. Früher war es üblich, SF-Klassen sieben Jahre lang zu übernehmen, mittlerweile gilt bei vielen Versicherungen eine Frist von zehn Jahren. Einige erkennen den SF-Rabatt sogar zwölf Jahre lang oder gar unbegrenzt an. Was es noch zu beachten gibt Versicherer rechnen alte Rabatte nur an, wenn die SF-Klasse nachprüfbar ist. Aus diesem Grund sollte man nach Abmeldung eines Fahrzeugs die Versicherungsunterlagen aufbewahren, damit man die alte Vertragsnummer angeben kann – für den Fall, dass man wieder ein Auto versichern will. Anhand der Vertragsnummer kann die Versicherung die Daten in den eigenen Akten wiederfinden. Wer sich bei der Neuanmeldung für ein anderes Versicherungsunternehmen entscheidet, kann die SF-Klasse übertragen lassen. Dafür muss die neue Versicherung beim vorherigen Anbieter die SF-Klasse erfragen.",,rss,"The article, titled ""Welche Schadenfreiheitsklassen gibt es?"", does not focus on electric vehicles but rather on explaining the system of no-claims classes (Schadenfreiheitsklassen) in automotive insurance in Germany.

Sie ist ein Durchschnittswert aller angebotenen Modelle und variiert je nach Hersteller, Modell und Händler. Berühmt ist der SM in erster Linie für seine originelle und für die 1970er-Jahre sehr futuristische Optik: lange Motorhaube, flaches Dach, versteckte Hinterräder und Scheinwerfer, die – wie auch das Nummernschild – hinter einer Glasverkleidung sitzen. Bemerkenswert: Der SM verfügte bereits über adaptives Kurvenlicht – in den 70ern! Der Höhepunkt in Sachen Komfort war natürlich die hydropneumatische Federung, die bereits im DS verbaut war. Doch der SM konnte nicht nur gemütlich! Denn das eigentliche Ziel der Franzosen wurde weit überschritten: Wollten sie ursprünglich ein Auto mit Vorderradantrieb, das mehr als 180 km/h erreicht, gelang ihnen sogar eine Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 225 km/h! Kommt das Tribute-Modell mit V6? (Update!) Und so viel Exklusivität will doch gewürdigt werden. Daher präsentiert das DS Design Studio Paris eine Studie eines neuen SM, den SM Tribute . Doch entgegen der kürzlich immer häufiger aufkommenden Gerüchte rund um eine Kleinserie, berichtet motor1 , dass aus diesem Traum zunächst keine Realität werden wird. Aber: Sollte eines Tages aus dem Tribute-Modell doch mehr werden als eine Studie, dann wird der DS nicht mit einem Elektroantrieb – wie bisher angenommen – unterwegs sein, sondern ebenfalls wieder mit einem V6-Motor aus dem Hause Maserati . Ganz wie beim Original! Weiterentwicklung statt Neuentwicklung Wichtig war dem DS Design Studio Paris, dass mit der Studie nicht bloß ein möglichst modernes Konzept geschaffen wurde. Die Hommage sollte so aussehen, als wäre die Produktion des SM nicht 1975 beendet worden, sondern, als wäre immer wieder eine neue Generation auf den Markt gekommen. Also eine Weiterentwicklung, keine Neuentwicklung. Zoom Laut DS Design Studio Paris könnte der SM heute so aussehen, wenn man ihn immer weiterentwickelt hätte.

Der alte SM ist an jeder Ecke zu erkennen Die wichtigsten Merkmale des SM sind natürlich geblieben: Darunter beispielsweise die abnehmbare Radabdeckung, die gläserne Verkleidung an der Front, die bei der Studie jedoch durch einen 3D-Bildschirm repräsentiert wird, die stromlinienartige Karosserie mit schmal zulaufendem Heck und ebenfalls die zweifarbige Lackierung. Hier entschied sich das DS Design Studio Paris sowohl für schwarz als auch für Gold Leaf – diese Farbe wurde bereits 1971 angeboten. Zoom Wie auch beim Original: Das Heck verjüngt sich.

Die maximale Reichweite unter den Bedingungen des WLTP liegt bei 620 km. Angeboten wird der Ioniq 9 mit drei Antrieben. Das Basismodell mit einem Motor im Heck bietet 160 kW. Diesen E-Motor haben alle Versionen. In den Allradlern kommen vorn entweder ein 70-kW-Motor oder einer mit 160 kW hinzu. Die Systemleistung liegt dann bei 230 oder 320 kW. Alle Versionen werden auf 200 km/h begrenzt. Bild 1 von 12 Hyundai Ioniq 9 (12 Bilder) Der Hyundai Ioniq 9 wirkt live nochmals deutlich wuchtiger als auf den Bildern. (Bild: Hyundai ) Preis: vermutlich ab 70.000 Euro In den USA und Südkorea wird der Hyundai Ioniq 9 bereits Anfang des kommenden Jahres eingeführt. Wann das große Auto auf dem europäischen Markt zu haben ist, steht noch nicht exakt fest. Wir rechnen mit einem Start noch in der ersten Jahreshälfte, obwohl aus den eingangs genannten Gründen Europa eine untergeordnete Rolle in den Überlegungen spielt. Einer allzu großen Verbreitung steht schließlich auch der Preis entgegen. Hyundai lässt sich diesbezüglich noch nicht in die Karten schauen, doch mit rund 70.000 Euro für das Basismodell darf gerechnet werden.

Von Leidenschaft bis Chaos: Die zwei Gesichter des Auto-Tunings,Zwischen kreativer Perfektion und öffentlichem Ärgernis: Tuning spaltet die Gemüter und offenbart einen tiefen Konflikt in der Autowelt.,https://www.autobild.de/artikel/tuning-zwischen-kreativitaet-und-krawall-27698209.html,,2024-11-20 23:00:00,Robin Hornig,,"Schuldig, ich bekenne mich dazu, eine Leidenschaft für Tuning zu haben. Ich liebe es, wie Menschen sich bis ins kleinste Detail mit ihren Autos beschäftigen. Wie sie tüfteln, schrauben und optimieren, bis das Fahrzeug nicht nur einzigartig aussieht, sondern auch eine individuelle Handschrift trägt. Natürlich gehen die Geschmäcker auseinander – und das ist auch gut so. Persönlich stehe ich weniger auf extreme Tieferlegung mit Luftfahrwerk oder verspielte Umbauten, die kaum noch fahrbar sind. Für mich liegt der Reiz in zeitgenössischem Tuning der 80er, 90er und frühen 2000er. Die Performance zu verbessern, alles legal, abgenommen und eingetragen. Sonderausstellung ""Faszination Tuning – VW vs. Opel"" Umso mehr begeistert es mich, dass das Technik Museum Sinsheim jetzt die Sonderausstellung ""Faszination Tuning – VW vs. Opel "" eröffnet hat. Hier treffen die Rivalen VW und Opel in einer Sammlung aufeinander – von den Klassikern der 70er bis hin zu modernen Umbauten, die die Geschichte des Tunings erzählen. Zoom Breitbau ist längst wieder im Trend, und auch die Farbkombination bekommt heute wieder einen Daumen hoch. Bild: Hersteller Mehr als 100 Fahrzeuge sind zu sehen, darunter Klassiker wie der VW Golf GTI und der Opel Kadett , die bis heute die Faszination der Szene widerspiegeln. Die Ausstellung beleuchtet die Entwicklung des Tunings – von den improvisierten Modifikationen der frühen Tage bis hin zu den komplexen Umbauten der Gegenwart. Die dunkle Seite des Tunings Doch während in Sinsheim die technische Kreativität gefeiert wird, zeigt sich andernorts ein anderes Bild. In meiner Heimatregion Bad Oeynhausen (NRW) eskalierte kürzlich ein illegales Tuning-Treffen, das über Social Media organisiert wurde. Über 1000 Teilnehmer und Tausende Schaulustige blockierten den Parkplatz eines Einkaufszentrums. Neben dem Zeigen der Autos ging es schnell in die Extreme: heulende Motoren, Beschleunigungen, Burn-outs und Feuerwerkskörper. Die Polizei musste Verstärkung anfordern und schließlich die Zufahrten sperren, um das Chaos einzudämmen. Diese Veranstaltung hatte mit echtem Tuning nichts zu tun. Für mich war das nicht ""Fast & Furious"", sondern ""Dumm & Dümmer"". Dieser Vorfall zeigt eine traurige neue Rivalität: Tuner vs. Auto-Poser. Die einen leben ihr Hobby aus Leidenschaft und Respekt, oft über Jahre hinweg. Sie investieren in Technik, Design und Individualität – kurz, sie lassen das Auto für sich sprechen. Die anderen, die Poser, interessieren sich nur für Show und Klicks. Sie besetzen Innenstädte und Parkplätze, oft ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste. Während echte Tuner die Verantwortung und die technische Raffinesse ihres Hobbys schätzen, sind den Posern Respekt und Gemeinschaft egal.

Workers at Kentucky electric vehicle battery production complex start drive to unionize,Workers hired for an electric vehicle battery production complex in Kentucky have launched a campaign to join the United Auto Workers,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/workers-kentucky-electric-vehicle-battery-production-complex-start-116063370,,2024-11-20 22:58:00,ABC,,"Workers hired for an electric vehicle battery production complex in Kentucky have launched a campaign to join the United Auto Workers LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Workers hired for a sprawling electric vehicle battery production complex in Kentucky have launched a campaign to join the United Auto Workers as the union tries to expand its foothold in the South and among battery factories, the UAW said Wednesday. The BlueOval SK complex at Glendale is a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and its South Korean partner, SK On, to produce batteries for Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles. The nearly $6 billion battery park — about an hour south of Louisville — is gearing up to start manufacturing in 2025. The union said a supermajority of workers at BlueOval SK have signed union authorization cards to launch the public campaign to join the UAW. The union will need to seek an election run by the National Labor Relations Board to organize workers at the two-plant complex in Kentucky. So far it has not filed papers seeking an election. Production at one of the plants is scheduled to start next year. Construction continues at the second plant but a start date for production has been paused as Ford monitors demand for electric vehicles. In a statement on its website, the union said it believes companies like Blue Oval SK “can do better to provide career-track, family-sustaining jobs that strengthen our community."" Asked for a response to the unionizing effort, BlueOval SK human resources Director Neva Burke said in a statement: “We want to maintain a direct relationship with our employees.” The UAW said workers at Blue Oval SK, who are now nonunion, have weaker benefits than union workers at Ford. At Blue Oval, workers start at $21 per hour, while UAW production workers at Ford start at $26.32 and can make up to $42 per hour after three years, the union said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has called the project a “game changer” for the state. “We know that EVs are the future,” Beshear said recently. ""We don’t know how quickly they’ll get here, but the future has been built in Kentucky, and we’re going to be a really big part of it.” The UAW is hoping for a repeat of its successes in neighboring states. Workers at a General Motors joint venture electric vehicle battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, joined the union. Workers at a Volkswagen assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, also voted to unionize. In Ohio, workers at another GM joint venture electric vehicle battery factory voted to join the UAW.

Holpriger Start Kontrolliert wurde das Streaming-Spektakel von einem echten Fahrlehrer namens Fabian. Als Erstes setzte sich Internet-Legende MontanaBlack ans Steuer – und fiel bereits nach wenigen Sekunden gleich zweimal durch. Der gebürtige Buxtehuder schaltete in den Leerlauf, verließ das Auto aber kurz darauf. Hätte Fahrlehrer Fabian nicht eingegriffen, wäre das Fahrzeug unkontrolliert weggerollt. Als Monte, wie der Twitch-Star auch genannt wird, kurz darauf die Fahrt begann, folgte der nächste fatale Fehler: Er fuhr los, ohne zu blinken, sich umzuschauen und den Schulterblick zu machen. In der anschließenden Fahrt machte der gebürtige Buxtehuder aber eine gute Figur. Hin und wieder unterliefen ihm allerdings ein paar Flüchtigkeitsfehler und er fiel einige Male negativ durch einhändiges Lenken auf. Reihern statt feiern? Auch Zarbex und Sascha Hellinger erwiesen sich als gute, aber bei Weitem nicht fehlerfreie Fahrer. So fuhr Zarbex zweimal hintereinander über eine durchgezogene Linie und stellenweise auch mit überhöhter Geschwindigkeit, während Hellinger anfangs das Blinken vergaß und auf einer Kreuzung den Motor abwürgte. Sein Fahrstil wirkte sich zudem auf die Mägen seiner Beifahrer aus. So klagte Zarbex mehrfach über Übelkeit. MontanaBlacks ironisches Schlusswort lautete: ""Dein Fahrstil ist zum Kotzen."" Bei der theoretischen Prüfung glänzte keiner der drei: Alle fielen recht deutlich durch – Monte sogar mit 51 Fehlerpunkten. Zum Vergleich: Man darf sich maximal zehn Fehlerpunkte erlauben, um den theoretischen Test zu bestehen. Alles Show? Dass die Führerscheinprüfung eine Extremsituation ist, die den Alltag vieler Autofahrerinnen und -fahrer nicht widerspiegelt, bestätigte Fahrlehrer Fabian mit einer interessanten Aussage. Die Frage von MontanaBlack, ob der Profi Tempo 30er-Zonen mag, verneinte er und ergänzte: ""Was ich arbeite und ausbilde, ist jetzt nicht unbedingt das, was ich selber fahre."" Wichtig zu wissen: Die Prüfungssituation, die im Livestream dargestellt wurde, unterscheidet sich deutlich von der Tatsächlichen. So gab es für die Prüflinge während der Fahrt immer wieder Ablenkung durch laute Geräusche oder E-Zigarettenrauch von den Beifahrern auf der Rückbank. Der Stream ist daher als Unterhaltungsstück und nicht als Lerninhalt zu betrachten.",,rss,"The article titled 'Prominente Twitch-Stars rasseln durch Fahrprüfung' focuses on the entertaining aspect of Twitch stars undergoing a driving test in a livestream setting and thus does not provide any unique insights or analysis about electric vehicles (E-vehicles).

Ich bekenne mich dazu, eine Leidenschaft für Tuning zu haben. Ich liebe es, wie Menschen sich bis ins kleinste Detail mit ihren Autos beschäftigen. Wie sie tüfteln, schrauben und optimie­ren, bis das Fahrzeug nicht nur einzigartig aussieht, sondern auch eine individuelle Handschrift trägt. Natürlich gehen die Geschmäcker auseinander – und das ist auch gut so. Persönlich stehe ich weniger auf extreme Tieferlegung mit Luft­fahrwerk oder verspielte Umbau­ten, die kaum noch fahrbar sind. Für mich liegt der Reiz in zeitge­nössischem Tuning der 80er, 90er und frühen 2000er. Die Perfor­mance zu verbessern, alles legal, abgenommen und eingetragen . Hinweis Jetzt die aktuelle AUTO BILD sichern Zum Angebot Direkt bestellen Umso mehr begeistert es mich, dass das Technik Museum Sins­heim jetzt die Sonderausstellung ""Faszination Tuning – VW vs. Opel"" eröffnet hat. Hier treffen die Rivalen VW und Opel in einer Sammlung aufeinander – von den Klassikern der 70er bis hin zu mo­dernen Umbauten, die die Ge­schichte des Tunings erzählen. Mehr als 100 Fahrzeuge sind zu sehen, darunter Klassiker wie der VW Golf GTI und der Opel Kadett, die bis heute die Faszination der Szene widerspiegeln. Die Ausstellung beleuchtet die Entwicklung des Tunings – von den improvisierten Modifikationen der frühen Tage bis hin zu den komplexen Umbauten der Gegenwart . Zoom AUTO BILD-Chefredakteur Robin Hornig. Bild: AUTO BILD Doch während in Sinsheim die technische Kreativität gefeiert wird, zeigt sich andernorts ein an­deres Bild. In meiner Heimat­region Bad Oeynhausen (NRW) eskalierte kürzlich ein illegales Tu­ning-­Treffen, das über Social Me­dia organisiert wurde. Über 1000 Teilnehmer und Tausende Schau­lustige blockierten den Parkplatz eines Einkaufszentrums. Neben dem Zeigen der Autos ging es schnell in die Extreme: heulende Motoren, Beschleunigungen, Burn­outs und Feuerwerkskörper. Die Polizei musste Verstärkung anfordern und schließlich die Zufahr­ten sperren, um das Chaos einzu­dämmen. Diese Veranstaltung hatte mit echtem Tuning nichts zu tun. Für mich war das nicht ""Fast & Furious"", sondern ""Dumm & Dümmer"" . Hinweis AUTO BILD im Abo: kostenlose Lieferung + Prämie für Ihre Bestellung Zum Angebot JETZT SICHERN Dieser Vorfall zeigt eine traurige neue Rivalität: Tuner vs. Auto­-Poser. Die einen leben ihr Hobby aus Leidenschaft und Respekt, oft über Jahre hinweg. Sie investieren in Technik, Design und Individu­alität – kurz, sie lassen das Auto für sich sprechen. Die anderen, die Poser, interessieren sich nur für Show und Klicks. Sie besetzen Innenstädte und Parkplätze, oft ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste. Wäh­rend echte Tuner die Verant­wortung und die technische Raf­finesse ihres Hobbys schätzen, sind den Posern Respekt und Ge­meinschaft egal. Es geht ihnen um Selbstdarstellung und Reichweite auf Social Media. Das Auto ist da nur Mittel zum Zweck . In wenigen Tagen öffnet die Es­sen Motor Show – ein echtes High­light für alle, die Tuning als krea­tive und technische Leidenschaft sehen. Auf diese Messe freue ich mich schon jetzt – und hoffe in­ständig, dass sie frei bleibt von Posern, die das Bild des Tunings in der Öffentlichkeit weiter be­schädigen könnten.

Hightech-Verbrennungsmotor für den CLA,Mercedes baut in China einen neuen Hightech-Verbrenner. Sein Debüt wird der Benziner M252 im kommenden Mercedes CLA geben.

Mit dem neuen 1,5-Liter-Benziner M252 liefert der Stuttgarter Hersteller ein Hightech-Aggregat, das in der kommenden Generation des Mercedes CLA debütieren wird. Der M252 ergänzt die modulare Motorenfamilie von Mercedes, die bislang den 2,0-Liter-M254 und den 3,0-Liter-Sechszylinder M256 umfasst. Mit 1,5 Liter Hubraum ist er das kleinste Mitglied der Familie – aber alles andere als unscheinbar. Dank modernster Technologien wie dem ""Miller-Zyklus"" und einer Zylinderlaufbahn aus nanokristallinem Eisenspray reduziert der Motor Reibung, spart Sprit und wiegt dabei gerade einmal 140 Kilo. Neuer Mercedes-Benziner ist klein, leicht und effizient Der M252 kommt in drei Versionen: 136 PS, 163 PS und 190 PS. Innerhalb eines 48-Volt-Mildhybridsystems wird der Vierzylinder der zusätzliche 27 PS liefert. Der E-Motor sorgt nicht nur für einen ordentlichen Schub im unteren Drehzahlbereich, sondern ermöglicht auch rein elektrisches Fahren bis 100 km/h – ideal für Stadtfahrten und kurze Strecken. Zoom Mit dem neuen 1,5-Liter-Benziner M252 liefert Mercedes ein echtes Hightech-Aggregat. Bild: Mercedes Mit dem M252 will Mercedes zeigen, dass moderne Verbrenner den strengsten Umweltstandards gerecht werden können.

Four electric vehicle trends that will help you transition to net zero,Technology and legislation evolves rapidly in the developing electric vehicle sector. We highlight some potential changes which will impact fleets.,https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/features/four-electric-vehicle-trends-to-watch-out-for,,2024-11-20 10:04:00,Fleet News,,"This feature was taken from our Electric Fleet: Moving to Net Zero special report. Technology and legislation evolves rapidly in the developing electric vehicle sector. We highlight four potential changes which will impact fleets: 1 Battery health 2 Battery chemistry 3 Plug-and-charge 4 Wireless charging Calls are continuing from the automotive sector to introduce battery health certificates for electric vehicles (EVs), with the aim of giving confidence in the technology to used car buyers as well as better inform residual value setters. Under its Plan for the Automotive Sector, published in October 2023, Labour pledged to introduce a standardised battery health certificate for used EVs. The Government has also helped the UN develop a global technical regulation on United Nations Global Technical Regulation Number 22 on EV batteries (GTR 22), says Abdul Chowdhury, head of vehicle policy at the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV). “GTR 22 provides the requirement for a battery state of health monitor which is in an easily accessible manner, such as through the vehicle’s dashboard, so, essentially, you get a battery health figure like you do on your iPhone,” he adds. “It also details minimum performance standards for EV batteries, which have already been incorporated into UK regulations through the ZEV Mandate’s warranty requirements. “Secondly, the regulations also mandate that the batteries need minimum performance standards so they are not degrading quicker than they should. “Historically, the mileage of a vehicle was a strong indicator for its life expectancy and you could examine an engine to see if the head gasket was about to go, for example. “Obviously, you can’t do that in the same way for a battery and that’s where there could be a role for things like battery health certificates to help correctly assign a value for the vehicle.” In research published last month telematics provider Geotab analysed the battery health of almost 5,000 fleet and private EVs, representing nearly 1.5 million days of data, and found batteries degrade, on average, by 1.8% per year. This compares with 2.3% when it last performed a wholesale analysis of EV battery health in 2019. It found batteries in high-use EVs did not show significantly higher battery degradation than in lower use vehicles. David Savage, vice-president for the UK and Ireland at Geotab, says: “With these higher levels of sustained health, batteries in the latest EV models will comfortably outlast the usable life of the vehicle and will likely not need to be replaced. “The fact is that a 1.8% decline in battery health is unlikely to have a significant impact on most drivers’ daily vehicle needs, and this number will only come down further with new EV models and improved battery technology.” Battery degradation is a natural process that permanently reduces the amount of energy a battery can store or the amount of power it can deliver. The traction battery is essentially the heart of an EV – it is the single most expensive component and also has a critical bearing its operation, having a huge influence on factors such as range and charging speeds. Currently, all production EVs sold in the UK use lithium-ion chemistry, but different manufacturers may choose different ingredients for their battery cells. For example, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) is one of the most popular chemistries, but many manufacturers are looking to reduce their use of nickel and cobalt – therefore cutting costs – in their batteries, or switching to alternatives such as lithium-ion phosphate (LFP). The share of LFP batteries in EV sales remains below 10%, with high-nickel chemistries still most common, says the International Energy Agency. “Further declines in battery cost and critical mineral reliance might come from sodium-ion batteries,” it adds. “The need for critical minerals like nickel and manganese for sodium-ion batteries depends on the cathode chemistry used, but no sodium-ion chemistries require lithium.” However, for many experts solid-state batteries are the Holy Grail for EVs as they offer greater range, faster charging times and increased safety over lithium-ion units. The major advantage they have is that they use solid electrolytes as opposed to liquid. In practical terms, this gives them a greater energy density which means they can hold anywhere between two to 10 times the energy of a similar-sized lithium-ion battery. They will also charge faster as the solid electrolyte will not suffer the same over-heating issues as the liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries. Degradation will also be lower. Furthermore, as solid-state batteries do not have the flammable liquid electrolytes of a lithium-ion battery, they also have a much lower risk of fire. “The rollout of DC ultra-fast charging, combined with solid-state batteries, could allow us to move to a situation where the recharging of the battery can be much more akin to the petrol station experience by really cutting down on those charging times,” says Jonathan Davenport, senior director analyst at technology analysts Gartner. Car manufacturers are keen to adopt the technology, with Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz all known to be developing it. Mercedes-Benz, for example, expects its next-gen batteries to go into production for passenger vehicles by 2030, with Nissan setting a date of 2029. “We are finally in the phase of scaling up on our solid-state battery line,” says Shunichi Inamijima, corporate vice-president at Nissan. “Our solid-state battery technology is a game-changer for making EV sales grow explosively.” Under plug-and-charge, an EV driver will simply be able to plug their vehicle into a charge point and the two will automatically process payment information: no payment cards or apps will be needed. It uses standard ISO 15118, which is a new form of encrypted communication between an EV and a charge point, and involves asymmetric cryptography: a pairing of public and private security keys, neither of which can be decrypted without the other. This allows for a high degree of data security and integrity, and means that once an EV owner has set up their payment and authentication information, everything else is taken care of. “Plug-and-charge will really simplify things for fleets,” says Jonathan Davenport, senior director analyst, of technology analysts Gartner. Tesla developed its proprietary version of plug-and-charge 10 years ago. Octopus Electroverse also offers access to the technology, although this is limited to a small number of Volkswagen Group cars and BMWs on just the Ionity charging network. Gartner expects the technology will enter the mainstream within the next five to 10 years. Davenport says one potential obstacle to this is the current dominance by existing large credit card/payment providers that have brand awareness and who may feel their market presence may be threatened by the advent of an alternative payment solution. A second trial of electric vehicle wireless charging is currently underway in the Midlands, further investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of the technology. Being led by Coventry University and Coventry City Council, in collaboration with Cenex, the Dynacov – short for dynamic charging of vehicles - initiative uses a coil implanted just below the road surface that establishes a connection with vehicles and charges them wirelessly as they drive over. The technology could be deployed for buses and logistics vehicles, says the university. “Solutions like this will enable the transition to electric vehicles to happen more quickly,” adds Jim O’Boyle, Coventry City Council’s cabinet member for jobs, regeneration and climate change. The project is being funded by National Grid Electricity Distribution and is focused on a section of Kenilworth Road at its junction with the A45. If successful, it is hoped this project will attract Government support and funding to further develop the technology. Coventry University was also involved in the Wireless Charging of Taxi (WiCET) trial in Nottingham, which ran for four months and ended in January last year. This saw a fleet of electric and range-extender taxis wirelessly charge using five 11kW induction charging pads installed in the ground in the taxi rank in Trent Street, outside the central railway station, while they were stationary and waiting for their next fare. Nine vehicles - five LEVC TXs and four Nissan eNV200 Dynamo taxi conversions – were modified so they could charge when the driver, using the guidance of an HMI screen in the cabin, aligned their vehicle over a ground pad. The system was able to differentiate between cars and the appropriate drivers were then billed through a web-based app, meaning they did not have to leave their cars at all during the charging process. The wireless charging system achieved 90% power transfer efficiency, which makes it comparable with plug-in chargers. “The charging facility was aimed at top-up charging rather than being a replacement for plug-in charging,” says Richard Sander, technical consultant and project manager at Cenex, which led the initiative. He likens this approach to ‘grazing’, where the battery is kept at a consistent state of charge instead of running the battery down and then recharging fully. Overall findings showed wireless charging works and would have numerous benefits for many fleets, says Sander. “Some benefits will be very obvious, some less so,” he adds. “It’s very easy to use once the driver is used to it. “They drive up, line up and the EV starts charging until they drive away. It avoids having any cables lying around which can get damaged or be trip hazards, so it’s perfect for operational working areas. “There are not any exposed electrical contacts, so it’s well suited to dirty environments; there are no moving mechanical parts, so there is less wear and tear. “There is the potential to deploy it with minimal or no street furniture/hardware on the charging site, and if you can deploy it for top-up charging you could potentially reduce the size and weight of the propulsion battery within the vehicle.” Decarbonising a fleet is not just about replacing an ICE vehicle with a like-for-like electric replacement – it may open the door to other, more operationally efficient transport modes. In our new Electric Fleet: Moving to Net Zero special report, we look at the fleets that are already utilising flying drones, rolling robots or powered mobility such as e-cargo bikes and light vehicles, assessing use cases and considerations for organisations looking to pilot these options. We also look ahead to forthcoming battery electric technology to evaluate its potential impact on fleet operations, with longer ranges and faster charging among the key benefits, as well as the potential of hydrogen, which is undergoing a number of Government-funded trials in the UK. Other topics we investigate include the ongoing impact of the ZEV Mandate and how fleet managers need to be prepared to take advantage of any potential deals offered by manufacturers, and technology trends – including batteries – which will have an influence on fleet operations. We also look at what fully-electric cars will hit the UK market over the next 12 to 18 months, some of which will offer a WLTP range of more than 400 miles.",Business,bing,"The article provides a comprehensive and detailed exploration of various emerging trends within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, specifically focusing on fleet operations.

"Most popular used electric cars could save owners £1,600 compared to petrol",The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said a study shows a requirement for each manufacturer to sell a minimum proportion of zero emission vehicles each year 'is working',https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/business/most-popular-used-electric-cars-34146465,,2024-11-20 08:24:00,The Mirror,,"Owners of the UK's most popular second-hand electric vehicles (EVs) could pocket an average saving of £1,600 annually compared to their petrol counterparts, new research suggests. \ The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), which carried out the study, noted that since early 2023, savings have increased as used EVs are ""no longer more expensive to buy"". The think tank believes this indicates that the policy requiring carmakers to sell a certain quota of zero emission vehicles (Zev) each year ""is working"". This comes ahead of a meeting between ministers and automotive industry leaders on Wednesday to consider relaxing the mandate. The ECIU's analysis considered the six top-selling EV models in the UK, evaluating their total cost of ownership, including purchase price and running expenses like electricity, against their petrol equivalents. The Audi e-tron topped the list with potential annual savings of about £2,600, while the Renault Zoe offered the least at approximately £875 per year. Since January 1, under the zero-emission vehicle (Zev) mandate ( introduced by the Tory government, a minimum of 22% of all new cars sold by each manufacturer in the UK this year must be emissions-free, typically meaning fully electric. This percentage is set to increase yearly until it hits 100% by 2035. Manufacturers who fail to comply with the mandate or do not utilise available flexibilities, such as rolling over credits from previous years, face a Government fine of £15,000 for every non-compliant vehicle sold over the limit. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has calculated that new electric vehicles purchased while the zero-emission vehicle mandate is active could save future second-hand buyers close to £40bn by 2035, as reported by The Sunday Times. Transportation Secretary Louise Haigh and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds are gearing up for discussions with car manufacturers, who are aiming to ease the mandate regulations. According to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the market for pure electric pre-owned cars is booming, with record sales seen lately. Some 53,423 of the cars were acquired between July and September, a significant jump of 57% from the same period in the previous year. Colin Walker, a transport analyst at ECIU, commented: ""Increasing numbers of regular families are now trading in for an EV on the second-hand market, taking advantage of the hundreds of pounds of savings they can generate every year, and turning their backs on paying the ‘petrol premium’ of their old car."" He praised the effectiveness of the prior government's Zev mandate policy, noting: ""The previous government’s Zev mandate policy is working, with manufacturers discounting their EVs as they compete for sales to hit their targets. 'As prices are driven down, sales are going up. The increasing number of new EVs being sold today will hit the used market in around three to four years’ time, opening up the opportunity for cheaper and cleaner electric driving to the majority of people, as most people buy their cars second-hand. ""Any slowdown in the roll out of EVs under the Zev mandate could cost British drivers millions if not billions of pounds in extra driving costs in the coming years.""",Uncategorized,bing,"The article offers interesting insights into the current trends in the electric vehicle (EV) market, specifically focusing on the savings potential for second-hand EV buyers in the UK.

This is significant for potential buyers who are price-sensitive and looking for cost-effective options in the EV market. 

Additionally, the article discusses the effectiveness of governmental policies (Zev mandate) on the automotive market, which would appeal to environmental advocates interested in the policy's influence on zero-emission vehicle sales and its broader impact on carbon emissions.

Automotive enthusiasts may also find the technical and statistical information about different car models and the percentage of required ZEV sales compelling.

Gruppe 1/2/3: Kindersitze für Kinder mit einem Gewicht von 9-36 kg,"Kindersitze der Gruppe 1/2/3 können ab neun Monaten bis zu einem Alter von 12 Jahren oder einer Körpergröße von 1,50 Metern verwendet werden. Wir haben verschiedene Hersteller getestet. Entdecken Sie die Top-Modelle!",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/kindersitze-gruppe-1-2-3-test-21305783.html,,2024-11-20 05:00:00,AUTO BILD,,"Der Kindersitz wächst mit dem Kind mit Um für jedes Alter eine gute Passform zu bieten, lassen sich die Sitze mindestens an der Kopfstütze, oft aber auch an anderen Punkten wie Lehne und Seitenwangen verstellen. Der Kindersitz wächst also im übertragenen Sinne mit dem Kind mit. Dabei teilt sich die Nutzung des Gruppe-1/2/3-Sitzes in zwei Phasen: zum einen als Sitz für das Kleinkind, zum anderen als Sitz für Kinder ab etwa vier Jahren bis zum Ende der Kindersitzpflicht. Fangkörper sollen Nackenverletzungen minimieren In der ersten Phase (bis ca. 4 Jahre) wird der Gruppe-1/2/3-Sitz wie ein Gruppe-1-Sitz genutzt. Für diese Zeit verfügt der Sitz entweder über einen Fangkörper oder ein eigenes Gurtsystem. Das Gurtsystem – im Idealfall ein Fünfpunktgurt-System – verteilt die Kräfte bei einem Unfall gleichmäßig auf Schultern, Hüfte und das Gurtschloss zwischen den Beinen, sodass sie insgesamt abgemildert werden (z.B. Britax Römer Advansafix III SICT). Bei einem Fangkörper-Sitz (z.B. Cybex Pallas 2-fix) hat das Kind eine Art Tischchen auf dem Schoß. Es soll Nackenverletzungen minimieren, indem das Kind bei einem Frontalaufprall vorne auf den Fangkörper gepresst wird und die Kraft so gleichmäßig auf den Fangkörper verteilt wird (ähnlich wie bei einem Airbag). Er ist in der Tiefe verstellbar, sodass auch größere Kinder Platz finden. Ein zusätzliches Gurtsystem für das Kind gibt es hier nicht – der Fangkörper muss mit dem Fahrzeuggurt fixiert werden. Im Fahrzeug befestigt wird der Gruppe-1/2/3-Sitz während der ersten Nutzungsphase per Isofix und Toptether (Fangkörper-Sitze i.d.R. nur Isofix). In der Regel verfügen alle neueren Fahrzeuge über Isofix-Annahmepunkte, im Zweifelsfall hilft die Typenliste des Kindersitz-Herstellers weiter. Alternativ zu Isofix kann auch der Fahrzeuggurt zur Befestigung genutzt werden. Er wird dann ähnlich wie bei der Babyschale im Sitz eingefädelt. Der Ausbau des Gurtsystems ist oft fummelig Sobald das Kind aus der ersten Nutzungsphase des Gruppe-1/2/3-Sitzes herausgewachsen ist, wird der Sitz umgebaut. Dies ist der Fall, wenn die Kopfstütze nicht mehr optimal sitzt oder das Kind das Gewicht von 18 Kilo überschritten hat. Für den Wechsel wird bei den Gurtsystem-Sitzen der sitzeigene Gurt für Kleinkinder ausgebaut. Da der Ausbau des Gurtsystems oft etwas fummelig und anstrengend ist, haben sich einige Hersteller Mechanismen überlegt, wie das Gurtsystem statt des Ausbaus einfach hinter die Sitzfläche gezogen werden kann. Wer öfter zwischen den Phasen hin und her wechseln möchte, weil der Sitz für mehrere Kinder genutzt wird, sollte deswegen unbedingt vor dem Kauf den Umbau des Gurtsystems ausprobieren. Beim Fangkörper-Sitz muss für die zweite Nutzungsphase lediglich der Fangkörper entfernt werden. Ab der zweiten Phase sichert der Dreipunktgurt Bei beiden Modellen wird der Kindersitz jetzt wie ein Gruppe-2/3-Sitz genutzt, das heißt, das Kind wird mit dem Dreipunktgurt des Fahrzeugs angeschnallt. Hierfür gibt es spezielle Gurtführungspunkte an der Kopfstütze sowie an der Sitzfläche, die einen optimalen Gurtverlauf gewährleisten. Außerdem kann nach dem Umbau die Kopfstütze weiter verstellt werden, sodass sie jetzt auch für das größere Kind passt. Optimal ist eine Einstellung zwei Fingerbreit über der Schulter. Mit der Kopfstütze verstellt sich auch die Gurtführung, sodass der Sicherheitsgurt immer direkt über der Schulter anliegt. Eventuelle Zusatzpolster für Kleinkinder können ebenfalls herausgenommen werden. Da das Kind in der zweiten Nutzungsphase per Fahrzeuggurt angeschnallt wird, muss keine zusätzliche Befestigung im Auto erfolgen. Es ist allerdings ratsam den Sitz zusätzlich über Isofix zu sichern. So ist er fixiert, auch wenn kein Kind darin sitzt. Wie andere Kindersitze auch, verfügen viele Gruppe-1/2/3-Sitze über Zusatzfunktionen. Darunter zum Beispiel ein zusätzlicher Seitenaufprallschutz, der seitliche Crashs abmildern soll. Oder eine Neigungsverstellung, die dafür sorgt, dass die Kinder beim Einschlafen nicht nach vorne kippen, sondern im sicheren Bereich des Kindersitzes verbleiben. Das Kind sitzt immer vorwärtsgerichtet Ganz gleich wie alt bzw. schwer das Kind im Sitz ist, der Gruppe-1/2/3-Sitz wird immer vorwärtsgerichtet im Auto installiert. Das bedeutet gleichzeitig, dass Eltern gerade in den ersten Monaten und Jahren nach der Babyschale auf den Vorteil des rückwärtsgerichteten Transportes verzichten müssen, wie ihn ein Reboarder bietet. Ob nun ein Sitz mit Gurtsystem oder Fangkörper ausgewählt wird, sollte vor allem davon abhängig gemacht werden, ob der Sitz zum Kind passt. Befürworter des Fangkörper-Sitzes heben hervor, dass es keinen einschneidenden Gurt gibt und gleichzeitig mehr Bewegungsfreiheit für das Kind geboten wird. Hersteller, die Fangkörper-Sitze nicht mehr anbieten, führen an, dass diese eine schlechtere Schlafposition bieten (Kind fällt nach vorne) und die Kinder durch das Tischchen auf ihren Beinen stärker schwitzen. Aber: Das Kind muss sich im Sitz wohlfühlen, denn ein quengelndes Kind ist ebenfalls ein Sicherheitsrisiko. Deswegen ist ein Probesitzen vor dem Kindersitzkauf besonders wichtig.

Mehr Fächer und Stauraum gibt es bei anderen, aber keinen vergleichbaren Wasserschutz und eine derartige Sichtbarkeit. Im Test erreichte der Ortlieb Commuter Daypack High Visibility die Note ""sehr gut"" – mit 31 von 35 Punkten. Basil Soho Nordlicht 1,8 gut Basil Soho Nordlicht 1,8 gut Gepäckträgerhalterung weich gepolsterte Schultergurte günstiger Preis bei seitlichem Regen nicht vollständig wasserdicht Zum Angebot Zum Anbieter Basil schickt neben Vaude einen Rucksack ins Rennen, der mit einer Gepäckträgerhalterung ausgestattet ist. Die Haken werden hinter einem Reißverschlussfach versteckt, könnten aber noch etwas mehr Schutz vertragen. Ausdrücklich lobten die Tester die weichen, gepolsterten Schultergurte. Weniger gut: Prasselt Wasser im 90-Grad-Winkel auf die Reißverschlussnähte des Hauptfachs ein, wird es im Hauptfach schnell feucht. Die wasserabweisende Laptoptasche (bis 15 Zoll) ist entnehmbar. Im Test erreichte der Basil Soho Nordlicht die Note ""gut"" – mit 25,5 von 35 Punkten. Im Wasserdichtigkeitstest mussten die Rucksäcke ein 3-mal-3-Minutenprotokoll absolvieren. Unter Ausstattung bepunkten wir die Taschenanzahl, Fächeraufteilung, Reflektoren. In Handhabung fließt u. a. ein, wie gut Taschen zugänglich sind. Unter Tragekomfort berücksichtigen wir Polster, Schultergurte, Einstellbarkeit. Beim Gewicht legen wir vier Sterne für den Bereich zwischen 1100 und 1199 Gramm an. Das Design haben fünf Redakteurinnen und Redakteure diskutiert. Rucksäcke sind in unzähligen Größen und Ausführungen im Handel erhältlich. BIKE BILD empfiehlt, gezielt Fahrradrucksäcke ins Visier zu nehmen. Die meisten Modelle bieten nützliche Features, sind mit Reflektoren ausgestattet, wasserdicht und – sehr wichtig – ergonomisch für Radler optimiert. Wichtig dabei: Viele Interessenten knüpfen ihre Kaufentscheidung an das Fassungsvermögen, aber schauen Sie besser primär aufs Rückenpolster. Schließlich trägt beim Rucksack die menschliche Wirbelsäule das Gros der Last. Keine Bange, unser Rückgrat schultert bei entsprechender Pflege (regelmäßige Stärkung und ausreichend Bewegung) moderate Alltagslasten mühelos. Auch das ist ein Argument für den Rucksack: Die Lasten werden auf die linke und rechte Körperhälfte gleichmäßig verteilt – vorausgesetzt, man packt entsprechend. Bildergalerie Kamera Rucksäcke für unterwegs: Testergebnisse 13 Bilder Zu harte Rückenpolster können bei gewölbter Wirbelsäule zu Problemen führen, insbesondere dann, wenn der Biker – betrifft vor allem Rennräder und Gravelbikes mit Höhenunterschied zwischen Sattel und Lenker – gebeugt auf dem Rad sitzt. Der Grat ist schmal, denn zu weiche Polster geben keinen ausreichenden Halt und begünstigen, dass der Inhalt unangenehmen Druck ausübt. Reden wir noch kurz übers Fassungsvermögen. Helm , Laptop und Trinkflasche haben wir in dem 18-Liter-Modell von Evoc untergebracht. Aus diesem Grund wird der Bereich zwischen 20 und 23,9 Litern mit vier Sternen (gut) bewertet. Damit dürften sich die meisten Radler zufriedengeben. Übrigens: Schonendes Packen verbessert den Tragekomfort. Schwere Einzelteile wie Laptops sollten nah am Rücken liegen. Leichte Gegenstände wie Wechselkleidung gehören in den Boden und Kleinteile ins Oberteil. Je besser die Lasten verteilt sind, desto sicherer lässt sich auch durch Kurven steuern. Ganz klar: Echte Alltagsfreude wird erst aufkommen, wenn Rücken und Rucksack wirklich zusammenpassen. Reden wir noch kurz übers Fassungsvermögen.

Bei Kälte braucht die Autobatterie Pflege,"Kälte schwächt die Autobatterie, während der Motor mehr Strom braucht – eine gefährliche Kombination und Ursache für die meisten Pannen im Winter. Mit der richtigen Pflege startet Ihr Auto auch im Winter zuverlässig. Das sind die wichtigsten Tipps.",https://www.autobild.de/artikel/autobatterie-im-winter-44097.html,,2024-11-20 05:00:00,Lena Trautermann,,"Die Autobatterie ist laut ADAC die häufigste Pannenursache. Besonders im Winter versagt sie oft – meist nach einer Einsatzzeit von fünf bis sechs Jahren. Doch eine Panne aufgrund einer schwachen Batterie lässt sich durch die richtige Pflege relativ einfach vermeiden. Der Winter stellt für die Autobatterie eine besondere Herausforderung dar: Durch die Kälte verliert sie an Kraft. Bei minus zehn Grad verliert die Autobatterie etwa ein Drittel ihrer Leistung, bei minus zwanzig Grad bleibt nur noch die Hälfte übrig. Hinzu kommt, dass der Motor der Batterie bei kalten Temperaturen mehr abverlangt: Das Motoröl ist sehr zähflüssig – bei minus zwanzig Grad verdoppelt sich so der Stromverbrauch beim Motorstart. Deswegen springen kalte Motoren bei Minusgraden oft nur widerwillig an. Zoom Die regelmäßige Pflege mit einem Ladegerät ist das A und O für ein langes Batterieleben. Bild: Ralf Timm Kommt dann noch häufiger Kurzstreckenbetrieb hinzu, ist die Batterie schnell am Limit: Wenn der tägliche Weg zur Arbeit nur ein paar Kilometer beträgt, dabei auch noch Heckscheiben- und Sitzheizung laufen, bleibt der Lichtmaschine zu wenig Zeit, um die Batterie ausreichend zu laden. Dann ist der Ausfall vorprogrammiert. Damit die Autobatterie im Winter fit bleibt und eine lange Lebensdauer hat, sollte man mit einigen Maßnahmen vorbeugen. Denn Wartungsfrei bedeutet nicht pflegefrei: Auch moderne Autobatterien brauchen regelmäßige Aufmerksamkeit: Batterie Aufladen: Pflege bedeutet bei modernen Starter-Akkus vor allem laden. Zwar sind moderne Akkus deutlich leistungsfähiger geworden, doch die vielen Verbraucher im Auto verlangen dem Akku auch immer mehr ab. Vor allem die Start-Stopp-Funktion trägt zum Leistungsverlust bei. Deswegen werden Starterbatterien in guten Werkstätten sofort an ein Ladegerät angeschlossen.

Wenn es unvermeidbar ist, die Spannung im Auge behalten und die Autobatterie regelmäßig zum Nachladen an ein Ladegerät anschließen. Stromverbrauch reduzieren: Gerade auf Kurzstrecken oder wenn lediglich die Zündung aktiviert ist, so wenig Verbraucher wie möglich verwenden.

Ruhespannung mindestens zwei Stunden nach der letzten Fahrt mit einem Multimeter Testen. Liegt die Spannung unter 12,4 Volt, ist der Akku bereits geschwächt. Unbedingt nachladen oder auf einer längeren Fahrt (mindestens 50 Kilometer) durch den Generator (Lichtmaschine) aufladen.

Batterie warmhalten: Wer noch mehr vorbeugen möchte, kann seine Batterie mit einem Thermoüberzug schützen – dann kühlt der Akku im Winter nicht so stark aus. Noch besser ist es (wenn möglich) das Auto in einer Garage unterstellen. Zoom Nur wenn die Klemmen richtig an den Polen anliegen, fließt genügend Strom. Mit einem Polschleifer die Batteriepole nachschneiden, danach mit Polfett schützen. Bild: Daniel Ewen Folgende Symptome können auf eine schwächelnde Autobatterie hindeuten: Der Anlasser dreht langsam, der Motor startet kaum. Die Ruhespannung beträgt unter 12,4 Volt Die Beleuchtung leuchtet beim Starten des Motors nur noch schwach oder fällt gar aus. Tipp: Auch ohne ein Spannungsmessgerät kann man den Zustand der Autobatterie überprüfen. Bei ausgeschaltetem Motor (Zündung ein) wird das Abblendlicht eingeschaltet. Nimmt die Lichtstärke der Scheinwerfer schon nach kurzer Zeit merklich ab, ist dies ein klares Indiz für eine schwache Batterie. Der Test klappt am besten bei Dunkelheit. Wer die Warnzeichen erkennt, muss die Batterie aber nicht sofort austauschen. Fürs Erste reicht es, die Batterie zu laden. Das geht entweder durch eine längere Fahrt (mindestens 30 Minuten und am besten über Land) oder durch das Anschließen ans Ladegerät . Streikt der Akku danach erneut, sollte er einer Prüfung unterzogen werden. Um der Autobatterie die Arbeit nicht noch zu erschweren, sollten allgemein vor dem Starten des Motors alle elektrischen Verbraucher (Beleuchtung, Radio, Gebläse etc.) ausgeschaltet sein. Bleibt das Starten erfolglos, nicht länger als zehn Sekunden versuchen. Dann mindestens eine halbe Minute pausieren und erneut probieren. Starthilfe: Ist der Akku bereits entladen und der Wagen springt gar nicht mehr an, ist Starthilfe nötig. Dabei kann ein anderes Fahrzeug mit seiner Batterie Pannenhilfe geben. Wichtig: die richtige Reihenfolge beim Verbinden der Batterien beachten ( mehr zur Starthilfe). Einfacher geht es mit den sogenannten Startboostern: Das sind kleine Lithium-Ionen-Akkus, die einer schlappen Batterie wieder auf die Sprünge helfen. Das Helfer-Auto und ein Starthilfekabel sind hier nicht mehr nötig. Einfach den Startbooster an die Batterie klemmen und das Fahrzeug starten.

Nur wenn er dann wieder schwächelt, muss er ersetzt werden. Wichtig: Das Ladegerät muss für den jeweiligen Batterietyp geeignet sein. Desulfatierung: Nützt auch das Aufladen mit dem Ladegerät nichts mehr, ist die Sulfatbildung meist zu weit fortgeschritten. Ein letzter Versuch kann die Desulfatierung mithilfe eines Batteriepulsers sein. Wer es gar nicht erst soweit kommen lassen will, kann den Batteriepulser auch dauerhaft an seine Autobatterie anschließen. Die Lebensdauer der Autobatterie soll sich damit bestenfalls verdoppeln lassen. Was Batterien überhaupt nicht mögen, ist die Tiefenentladung. Wurde zum Beispiel das Licht für längere Zeit angelassen oder der Wagen lange nicht gefahren, sinkt die Spannung in einen kritischen Bereich, die Kapazität nimmt stark ab – manchmal bis zum Totalausfall. Wichtig: Batterien niemals im entladenen Zustand stehen lassen, sondern sofort aufladen. Denn je länger die Spannung im kritischen Bereich bleibt, desto stärker wird die Batterie geschädigt. Deswegen ist auch empfehlenswert, eine wenig oder nur im Kurzstreckenbetrieb genutzte Batterie regelmäßig an ein Ladegerät anzuschließen. Zoom Diese Batterie ist mehr als 100 Jahre alt.

Welcher Eiskratzer sorgt für klare Sicht? Elf Exemplare im Test,"Der Eiskratzer ist unentbehrlich. Klassisch oder elektrisch, aus Plastik oder Metall, mit oder ohne Schneebesen: AUTO BILD hat elf Exemplare getestet.",https://www.autobild.de/produkttests/eiskratzer-test-21002413.html,,2024-11-19 14:00:00,Matthias Prinz,,"Für Autofahrer ohne Garage oder Standheizung bedeutet der Winter: Eiskratzen. Eine oft langwierige und anstrengende Tätigkeit, das Auto eisfrei und verkehrssicher zu machen. Deshalb hat AUTO BILD mit Unterstützung von Experten der KüS und Carglass elf Eiskratzer gründlich geprüft. Im Test standen sowohl klassische als auch elektrische Modelle, um zu ermitteln, welcher am effizientesten das Eis entfernt. Test-Empfehlung 1,4 sehr gut Heyner 995100 1,4 sehr gut hochwertige Verarbeitung zusätzlicher Besen gutes Handling Zum Angebot Mit großem Vorsprung kann sich der Heyner Snowstar M Pro im großen AUTO BILD Eiskratzer-Test behaupten. Das Produkt punktet nicht nur bei dünner, sondern auch bei dicker Eisschicht mit herausragenden Kratzleistungen. Die Länge des Eisschabers ist dank angeschlossenem Schneebesen auch ideal für große Fahrzeuge und ist verhältnismäßig handlich. Lediglich in den Staufächern der Türen findet der Heyner nur bedingt Platz. Der Preis von 16,90 Euro ist ob der hohen Qualität durchaus gerechtfertigt. Im Test hat der Heyner Snowstar M Pro 82 von 90 Punkten erreicht und erhielt die Note 1,4 (sehr gut). Test-Empfehlung 2,4 gut PETEX Eiskratzer (4502) 2,4 gut sehr gute Kratzleistung bei dünner Eisschicht nicht überzeugend bei dicker Eisschicht Zum Angebot Der Eiskratzer von Petex konnte bei dünner Eisschicht mit überdurchschnittlicher Kratzleistung überzeugen. Leichte Abzüge gibt es aber bei dicker Eisschicht. Bei verschmutzter Scheibe ist allerdings Vorsicht geboten: Hier waren nach unserem Test vereinzelt tiefe Kratzer gut zu erkennen. Im Test hat der Petex Eiskratzer 82 von 90 Punkten erreicht und erhielt die Note 2,4 (gut). Den Eiskratzer-Test hat AUTO BILD gemeinsam mit dem Sachverständigen Florian Ziehr der Prüforganisation KÜS sowie Carglass-Experten Christian Berteit durchgeführt. Das wichtigste Testkriterium: Natürlich die Kratzleistung. Um die zu testen, wurden mehrere Front- und Heckscheiben über Nacht in einem -21 Grad kalten Kühlcontainer eingefroren und anschließend mit einer dünnen bzw. dicken Eisschicht versehen. Zoom Die Eiskratzer mussten sich sowohl bei dünner als auch bei dicker Eisschicht beweisen. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Dabei wurden nicht nur saubere Scheiben präpariert. In der Realität sind Autoscheiben nie ganz sauber, daher wurden auch verschmutzte Scheiben für den Test vorbereitet. Denn auch wenn die Kratzer solide Leistungen bringen: Schon kleine Schmutzpartikel oder Sandkörner können beim Eiskratzen zu unschönen Kratzern auf der Scheibe führen. Zoom Nach dem Test werden alle Scheiben im abgetauten Zustand vom Carglass-Experten hinsichtlich möglicher Kratzer und Schäden untersucht. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Jeder Eiskratzer musste jedes Test-Szenario durchlaufen. Anschließend analysierte Carglass-Fachmann Christian Berteit die Beschädigungen auf den Scheiben, außerdem wurden Handhabung und Qualität von den Testern beurteilt. Der Eiskratzer-Test hat gleich gezeigt: Nicht jeder Eiskratzer eignet sich gut, um das Auto im Winter fahrtauglich zu machen. Das größte Problem sind viele und tiefe Kratzer, die die Helfer oft in der Scheibe hinterlassen. Zurückzuführen sind diese auf schlechte Kratzeigenschaften und mindere Materialqualität der Eisschaber sowie auf Anwendungsfehler, wie beispielsweise zu viel Druck oder der falsche Kratz-Winkel. Eiskratzer (2022): Test - Frontscheibe - Zubehör - Winter - Schnee Welcher Eiskratzer sorgt für klare Sicht? Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Von den elf getesteten Produkten bewertet AUTO BILD fünf mit ""mangelhaft"". Darunter ein Totalausfall: Ein Eisschaber hält dem Druck nicht stand und bricht in zwei Teile. Neben vier Modellen, die sich nur ein ""befriedigend"" abholen, gibt es lediglich zwei Produkte, die uns im Eiskratzer-Test überzeugen können. Wichtigstes Prüfkriterium: die Kratzleistung Bei der Kratzlestung beeindrucken die Produkte von Heyner und Petex mit hervorragenden Kratzleistungen und einer überdurchschnittlichen Produktqualität. Der Heyner Snowstar M Pro geht im AUTO BILD-Eiskratzer-Test 2021 vor allem wegen seiner außergewöhnlich guten Kratzeigenschaften als Testsieger hervor und kann sich so das Prädikat ""sehr gut"" sichern. Im abgetauten Zustand sind bei sauberer und schmutziger Scheibe nur wenige, kleine Kratzer erkennbar. Ähnlich gute Ergebnisse bei dünner Eisschicht liefert der Eisschaber von Petex, der bei dickem Eis etwas hinter dem Produkt von Heyner zurückbleibt, sich aber mit der Note ""gut"" den zweiten Platz sichert. Allerdings hinterlässt der Petex bei unserem Test an verschmutzter Scheibe vereinzelt tiefe Kratzer. Die Verlierer: Eiskratzer gebrochen Am unteren Ende der Skala positioniert sich der Glart Eiskratzer mit Handschuh, der während des Tests in zwei Teile zerbrochen ist, was eindeutig ""mangelhaft"" ist. Mit der gleichen Note hat der Eisfreund Premium Eiskratzer mit Handschuh abgeschnitten, der zwar ganz bleibt, aber schon bei dünner Eisschicht sehr schlechte Kratzergebnisse liefert. Bedingt durch die Materialqualität des Kratzers werden nach dem Test kleinere Beschädigungen an der Klinge festgestellt. Zoom Gebrochen: Der Glart Eiskratzer mit Handschuh kann dem Druck bereits bei dünner Eisschicht nicht mehr standhalten. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Vier Produkte nur ""befriedigend"" Im Mittelfeld findet man den Auprotec Eiskratzer – der einzige Eiskratzer mit Messingklinge im Test. Er liefert zwar beim Kratzen solide Ergebnisse, hinterlässt allerdings eine Vielzahl an Beschädigungen mit Messingabrieb. Bei weiteren Versuchen bei dicker Eisschicht wendet sich dieses Bild aber durch eine bessere Handhabung zum Positiven. Das Produkt von Auprotec erreicht insgesamt 61 Punkte von möglichen 90. Übung macht in diesem Fall den Meister. Punktgleich schließen der MID-IS von Kungs und der Eiskratzer von Michelin ab. Der Kungs liefert bei dünner Eisschicht ein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis, kann aber bei dickem Eis nicht überzeugen. Das Produkt von Michelin zeigt bei jeder Eis-Dicke Schwächen. Ähnlich wie der kleine Bruder schneidet auch der Kungs STAR-IS ab, der jedoch aufgrund seiner etwas sperrigen Form, bedingt durch den Teleskoparm und den Schneebesen, knapp dahinter liegt. Elektro-Eiskratzer überzeugen nicht Die meisten Autofahrer haben beim Eiskratzer einfache Modelle mit kurzem Griff und Klinge vor Augen. Doch mittlerweile gibt es sogar elektrisch betriebene Schaber, die einem das Leben deutlich erleichtern sollen. Die Modelle Kärcher EDI 4 und der 12-Volt-Eiskratzer von Lescars erinnern optisch an Poliermaschinen, verfügen aber an der Unterseite jeweils über eine rotierende Scheibe mit kleinen Plastikklingen. Während der Kärcher einen Akku besitzt, muss das Produkt von Lescars an der 12-Volt-Steckdose im Auto angeschlossen werden – eine zusätzliche Belastung für die Autobatterie, die bei kalten Temperaturen ohnehin gefordert ist. Der EDI 4 kann zwar beim Eiskratzen selbst überzeugen, aufgrund einer Vielzahl an Kratzern, die der Elektro-Gerät auf einer leicht verschmutzten Scheibe hinterlässt, muss das Produkt jedoch trotz guter Punktzahl auf ""mangelhaft"" herabgestuft werden. Zoom Zwar liefert der Kärcher EDI 4 tolle Ergebnisse ab, wegen vieler, tiefer Kratzer bei verschmutzter Scheibe muss er allerdings auf ein ""mangelhaft"" abgewertet werden. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Ein etwas anderes Bild hinterlässt der Lescars 12-Volt-Eiskratzer, dessen Kratzleistung enttäuscht. Lediglich die äußeren Kanten der Plastikklingen durchbrechen die dünne Eisschicht. Fazit: ""mangelhaft"".

Auch hier erfolgt die Stromversorgung über den 12V-Anschluss – nicht optimal. Anwender müssen hier viel Zeit mitbringen, da das Auftauen der Scheibe aufgrund des kleinen Heizelements sehr lange dauert. Auf keinen Fall darf dieses Teil die Scheiben berühren. Der Test hat gezeigt, dass bei Berührungen Kratzer entstehen, welche Metallpartikel enthalten, weshalb auch dieses Produkt nur mit ""mangelhaft"" bewertet wird. Zoom Insgesamt acht Autoscheiben werden in einem -21 Grad Celsius kalten Container eingefroren, um realistische Bedingungen zu simulieren. Bild: Sven Krieger / AUTO BILD Unser Test zeigt: Viele Eiskratzer hinterlassen tiefe Spuren auf den Autoscheiben, elektrische Modelle sind dabei gar nicht zu empfehlen. Der beste Tipp vom Carglass-Fachmann: am Abend auf eine saubere Scheibe zu achten. Dann ist das Risiko, am nächsten Tag seine Scheibe zu zerkratzen, deutlich geringer. Die Modelle von Heyner und Petex zeigen, dass sie nicht nur am besten kratzen, sondern hier auch die Gefahr von Beschädigungen an der Scheibe am geringsten ist. Der Petex Eiskratzer beweist, dass ein gutes Produkt nicht immer teuer sein muss – hier liegt der Preis bei 4,05 Euro. Obwohl sich viele Eisschaber bei dünner Eisschicht gut schlagen, versagen sie meist bei dickerer Eisschicht und in der Sichtprüfung nach dem Test: Viele Kratzer und Beschädigungen an der Scheibe sind das Ergebnis. Aus diesem Grund wurden nur zwei von elf Eiskratzern mit ""sehr gut"" bzw. ""gut"" bewertet. Testsieger (2021): Heyner Snowstar M Pro Test-Empfehlung 1,4 sehr gut Heyner 995100 1,4 sehr gut hochwertige Verarbeitung zusätzlicher Besen gutes Handling Zum Angebot Preis-Leistungs-Sieger (2021): Petex Eiskratzer Test-Empfehlung 2,4 gut PETEX Eiskratzer (4502) 2,4 gut sehr gute Kratzleistung bei dünner Eisschicht nicht überzeugend bei dicker Eisschicht Zum Angebot Wer noch keinen Eisschaber in seinem Auto hat, will sich vielleicht mit Alternativen behelfen. Beliebt sind dabei die CD-Hülle und die Plastikkarte, die jeder im Portemonnaie bei sich trägt. Schon bei dünner Eisschicht versagt die CD-Hülle nicht nur beim Eiskratzen, aufgrund des dünnen Kunststoffs splittern immer wieder Teile ab und beschädigen die Scheibe stark. Die Folge: viele tiefe Kratzer mit Plastiksplittern. Damit ruiniert man nicht nur die Scheibe, sondern auch die Wischer. Etwas besser schlägt sich die Plastikkarte: Das Ergebnis ist zufriedenstellend, jedoch dauert es ewig, bis die ganze Scheibe frei ist. Bei dicker Eisschicht versagt diese Alternative komplett. Zumindest ist diese Variante relativ schonend zur Scheibe: Kratzer sind hier kaum zu sehen. Einen guten Eiskratzer können allerdings weder CD-Hülle noch Plastikkarte ersetzen – hier handelt es sich tatsächlich nur um Notfalllösungen. • Um die Scheiben schonend von Eis zu befreien, am besten die Kombination aus Scheibenenteiser und Eiskratzer wählen. Der Enteiser löst zuerst das Eis, der Schaber erledigt den Rest. • Wer keine Kratzer riskieren möchte, sollte am Vorabend die Scheiben von Straßendreck befreien, denn saubere Scheiben vereisen weniger. Hier einfach vor dem Abstellen kurz die Scheibenwischanlage ( mit Winter-Scheibenreiniger ) betätigen. • Mit einer Thermoschutzfolie kann ein Zufrieren auch ohne Garage verhindert werden. Diese wird an der Frontscheibe angebracht und in Fahrer- und Beifahrertür eingeklemmt. • Wer sein Auto möglichst nah und mit der Front zu Hauswand abstellt, vermindert das Risiko vereister Scheiben. Nützliches Wissen rund um Eiskratzer Welcher ist der beste Eiskratzer? Der Testsieger im großen AUTO BILD-Eiskratzer-Test ist der Heyner Snowstar M Pro. Das Produkt punktet nicht nur bei dünner, sondern auch bei dicker Eisschicht mit herausragenden Kratzleistungen. Die Länge des Eisschabers ist dank angeschlossenem Schneebesen auch ideal für große Fahrzeuge und ist verhältnismäßig handlich. Lediglich in den Staufächern der Türen findet der Heyner nur bedingt Platz. Wie viel sollte ein guter Eiskratzer kosten? Der Testieger im AUTO BILD-Eiskratzer-Test, der Heyner Snowstar M Pro, ist zu einem Preis von 16,90 Euro erhältlich. Der Preis-Leistungs-Sieger, der Petex Eiskratzer, ist deutlich günstiger.

Unterschied zwischen Vollkasko und Teilkasko,Vollkasko oder Teilkasko – was lohnt sich für wen? Welche Versicherung deckt welche Schäden ab?

In der Teilkasko ist die Prämie fest, auch nach einem Schadensfall. Anders verhält es sich, wenn die Vollkaskoversicherung für einen Schaden aufkommt. Dann wird der Versicherte im nächsten Jahr in seiner Schadenfreiheitsklasse zurückgestuft. Damit steigt auch der Versicherungsbeitrag. Das kann je nach Rabattstufe gleich mehrere Hundert Euro Unterschied ausmachen.Die Versicherer kalkulieren zahlreiche Faktoren in den Kfz-Preis ein: Das Alter des Fahrers und des Fahrzeugs, die im Jahr gefahrenen Kilometer und die Typklasse des Autos. Auch der Zulassungsbezirk wirkt sich auf den Preis aus. Wer sein Auto in einer Region mit hoher Schadensbilanz zulässt, wird in eine teurere Regionalklasse eingestuft. In der Kaskoversicherung ist außerdem in der Regel eine Selbstbeteiligung vereinbart – in der Teilkasko oft 150 Euro, in der Vollkasko 300 Euro. Damit sinkt der Versicherungsbeitrag spürbar.

Krasser Wertzuwachs: Seltener Renault Clio V6 wird verkauft,Wer einen waschechten Sportwagen im Kleinwagenformat und mit wahrem Klassikerprestige kaufen will: Nun bietet sich die seltene Chance. Alle Infos!,https://www.autobild.de/artikel/renault-clio-v6-gebrauchtwagenmarkt-27690655.html,,2024-11-19 05:00:00,Kim-Sarah Biehl,,"""Aufregend"" ist vermutlich nicht das erste Wort, das einem beim Blick auf den Renault Clio der zweiten Generation einfällt. Und dennoch soll das seinerzeit der schnellste Kleinwagen der Welt gewesen sein? Naja, vielleicht nicht ganz. Denn natürlich ist nicht die Rede vom normalen, zahmen Clio, sondern vom weniger friedlichen Bruder, dem Clio V6. Produziert wird der ""böse"" Clio seit der Jahrtausendwende und viel geblieben ist vom Serienmodell nicht. Die V6-Variante ist bissiger, brutaler und breiter. Die Kotflügel rundum sind ausgestellt, vor den hinteren Radhäusern prangt ein großer Lufteinlass und abgerundet wird der Look von der auffälligen Frontstoßstange, den mächtigen Seitenschwellern und natürlich von beiden mittig sitzenden Endrohren am Heck. Understatement? Nein danke! Gebrauchtwagenmarkt Renault Clio II V6 3.0 Sport Phase 2, nur 41t km Preis:79.000 € 41.077 km 41.077 km 187 kW ( 254 PS) 187 kW ( 254 PS) 10/2003 Zum Angebot Wer den Wagen kennt weiß: Die Abgasrohre haben keinen weiten Weg, denn bei dem Kleinwagen handelt es sich um einen Mittelmotorsportler. Da wo einst eine Rückbank war, sitzt beim bösen Zwilling des Clio ein Drei-Liter-V6-Motor, der 254 PS und ein maximales Drehmoment von 300 Nm leistet. Das jedoch nur bei den Facelift-Modellen – wie bei diesem Inserat. Bis 2002 gabs den Clio V6 nur mit 226 PS. Was dann noch zur Zauberformel ""Spaß auf der Landstraße"" fehlt? Natürlich Heckantrieb und Handschaltung, was der schnelle Clio beides vorweisen kann. Doch auch die Höchstgeschwindigkeit ist mit 250 km/h nicht zu vernachlässigen, von 0 auf 100 km/h schafft es der Franzose in 5,8 Sekunden. (Vor dem Facelift waren es 6,4 Sekunden.) Der Clio kostet heute das Doppelte Bei diesen Werten und mit dem Wissen im Hinterkopf, dass von dem Clio mit V6 nicht einmal 3000 Exemplare produziert wurden, ist schnell klar, dass ein solcher Kauf teuer wird. In diesem Fall liegt der Preis bei 79.000 Euro. Das entspricht also ungefähr dem Doppelten des Neupreises, der lag bei 75.000 DM! Was hier noch inklusive ist: Eine sehr geringe Laufleistung von 41.000 Kilometern, eine ganz frische Plakette vom TÜV und die besondere Historie. Denn bei diesem Renault handelt es sich um eine belgische Ausführung, doch direkt nach der Fertigstellung wurde der Clio nach Japan verschifft und kam erst 2023 nach Deutschland.

40-Millimeter Gravelreifen – Welche sind empfehlenswert?,Für sicheres Fahren auf einem Gravelbike über unebenes Gelände sind qualitativ hochwertige Reifen entscheidend. BIKE BILD und AUTO BILD haben zehn Gravelreifen mit 40 Millimetern Breite getestet.,https://www.autobild.de/produkttests/gravelreifen-test-21701779.html,,2024-11-19 05:00:00,Lennart Klocke,,"Gravelbikes sind dafür gemacht, eine breite Palette an Terrains zu meistern, darunter Asphalt, Matsch, Waldboden, Sand und natürlich Schotter, nach dem sie benannt sind. Entsprechend kritisch ist die Rolle der Reifen, die den direkten Kontakt zum Untergrund herstellen. Sie müssen vielseitig sein und in mindestens einem Bereich besonders gut abschneiden. BIKE BILD hat zusammen mit AUTO BILD 2022 zehn Gravelreifen mit einer Breite von 40 Millimetern einer Prüfung unterzogen. Schwalbe G-One R 1,3 sehr gut Schwalbe G-One R 1,3 sehr gut top Pannenschutz in allen Kategorien überdurchschnittlich auch im Alltag sehr belastbar hoher Preis Zum Angebot Zum Anbieter Schwalbes Race-Reifen performt in allen Kategorien überdurchschnittlich gut. Aufgrund des Top-Pannenschutzes nicht nur eine gute Wahl am Renntag, sondern auch im täglichen Gebrauch sehr belastbar. Einziges Manko: der hohe Preis. Im Test erhielt der Schwalbe G-One R die Note 1,3 (sehr gut). Tufo Gravel Thundero 2,3 gut Tufo Gravel Thundero 2,3 gut guter Pannenschutz auf dem Niveau der Klassenbesten günstiger Preis Zum Angebot Zum Anbieter Der Gravel Thundero rollt auf dem Niveau der Klassenbesten, ohne dass die Hausaufgaben beim Pannenschutz und bei der Abdichtung vergessen wurden. Angesichts dieses Preises fragen wir uns: Warum mehr für einen Gravelreifen ausgeben? Im Test erhielt der Tufo Gravel Thundero die Note 2,3 (gut). Unseren Gravelreifen-Test haben wir in Kooperation mit Schwalbe an deren Firmensitz in Reichshof durchgeführt. Für den Rollwiderstandstest lief der Reifen über eine Messtrommel auf einer Felge mit 25 Milli-meter Innenweite, bei 2,5 Bar Luftdruck (tubeless) und 50 Kilogramm Gewichtslast. Um die Anfälligkeit für einen Durchschlag (Snakebite) zu bewerten, wurde der Reifen im Schlauchbetrieb dreimal von einem herabfallenden Keil attackiert. Je tiefer der Keil fallen musste, um den Schlauch zu perforieren, desto besser die Reifenstabilität. Die Pannenschutzwertung ist das Ergebnis von drei Messungen, bei denen eine Nadel und eine Klinge in Lauffläche und Seitenwand gebohrt wurden. Je größer der notwendige Kraftaufwand zum Durchbohren, desto besser der Pannenschutz. Um zu messen, wie gut die Reifen dichthalten, haben wir alle Muster mit 60 Milliliter Dichtmilch befüllt, montiert, eingewalkt und mit 3 Bar Ausgangsdruck 24 Stunden hängen lassen. Der Druckverlust nach dieser Zeit gibt Auskunft über die Dichtigkeit. Ganz subjektiv haben wir die Montage getestet: Redakteur und Labortechniker haben alle Reifen montiert und die technische Herausforderung sowie den notwendigen Krafteinsatz bewertet. Die Welt der Gravel-Reifen ist so vielfältig wie die der Gravelbikes selbst. Es gibt schmalere Allroad-Slicks, Stollenreifen, die nahe an 33-Millimeter-Cyclocrossmodellen sind oder breite, grobe Pneus, die man auch an Mountainbikes einsetzen könnte. Am beliebtesten ist die 40-Millimeter-Klasse für 28-Zoll-Felgen mit einem Noppen-Mischprofil. Diese ist für Gravelbiker der beste Kompromiss für viele verschiedene Anforderungsprofile, weswegen wir uns auch für diesen Test auf solche Modelle fokussiert haben. Unseren Vergleichstest haben wir im Labor vorgenommen. Nur unter kontrollierten Bedingungen und strenger Aufsicht von Redakteur und Techniker lassen sich reproduzierbare und aussagekräftige Ergebnisse erzielen. Insbesondere beim Thema Pannenschutz ist eine Vergleichbarkeit in der Praxis unmöglich. Ob man mit einem bestimmten Reifen häufiger eine Panne hat, hängt von der Umgebung ab, in der man fährt, und vom Glück oder Pech des jeweiligen Fahrers. Störfaktoren, die die Klinge auf dem Prüfstand eliminiert. Auch der Durchschlagstest, der einen sogenannten Snakebite simulieren soll, lässt sich nur im Labor seriös durchführen. Ein interessanter Teil des Tests war auch die Luftdruckmessung im Tubeless-Betrieb beziehungsweise die Abdichtung im genormten Set-up über mehrere Tage. Für die Praxistauglichkeit vieler Gravelbiker ein entscheidender Faktor, schließlich unternehmen viele Biker Mehrtagestouren, auf denen nicht immer eine große Pumpe bereitsteht. Und im täglichen Pendelbetrieb haben viele schlicht keine Lust, jeden Tag nachzupumpen. Nicht nur die Alltagstauglichkeit der Gravelreifen ist für Biker wichtig Klar, nicht nur die Alltagstauglichkeit ist wichtig für Gravelbiker, sondern auch die Performance. Der Rollwiderstandstest gibt Aufschluss darüber, wie effizient der Pneu abrollt. Nicht in die Wertung aufgenommen, aber ausgewiesen, haben wir den Punkt Gewicht. Wenngleich es auch im Gravelbereich Leichtbau-Enthusiasten gibt, beweisen unsere Daten, dass der Rollwiderstand der wesentliche Faktor ist, wenn es ums Fortkommen geht. Der beste Reifen nützt Ihnen nichts, wenn Sie ihn nicht auf das Rad oder im Fall einer Panne von der Felge ziehen können. Deshalb haben wir auch die Montage in unsere Bewertung aufgenommen.

Grundlage der Zahlen ist die Bundesnetzagentur, die regelmäßig die verfügbaren Ladepunkte ausweist, wie zuletzt zum Stichtag 1 Juli 2024. Den Zahlen zufolge standen für öffentliche Laden exakt 142.793 Ladepunkte zur Verfügung. Zum Stand 1. September sind sogar rund 3100 weitere hinzugekommen, an der Quote pro Auto ändert sich dabei aber wenig. In Deutschland waren Mitte 2024 laut Kraftfahrzeug-Bundesamt rund 2,48 Millionen E-Autos (auch Plug-in-Hybride) angemeldet. Dabei handelt es sich um all die öffentlichen Ladepunkte, die das Anzeigeverfahren der Bundesnetzagentur vollständig abgeschlossen haben und im Internet veröffentlicht wurden. (Hier ist die offizielle Ladesäulenkarte ). Die tatsächliche Zahl der Ladepunkte dürfte mittlerweile noch etwas höher liegen. Wo man noch gar nicht öffentlich laden kann Allerdings sticht ein nicht ganz so positiver Wert hervor: In einem Drittel der 10.752 Gemeinden in Deutschland gibt es noch keine einzige öffentlichen E-Auto-Ladestation, 73 Prozent verfügen über keine Möglichkeit zum Schnellladen . Immerhin ist bei der Entwicklung der Ausbau zu spüren: Vergangenes Jahr war noch die Hälfte aller Gemeinden ohne öffentliche Ladeinfrastruktur, die Zahl der schnellladelosen Gemeinden lag sogar bei 80 Prozent. Wie steht es ums Schnellladen? Beim Schnellladen teilen sich derzeit im Bundesdurchschnitt 82,4 E-Autos eine Ladesäule. Hier verglich das VDA die Verteilung auf Ebene der Bundesländer. Auch dieser Wert zeigt den Ausbau des öffentlichen Ladenetzes: vor einem Jahr kamen noch 111 E-Autos auf einen Schnellladepunkt. Allerdings spricht die Bundesnetzagentur schon oberhalb von 22 kW von Schnellladen, in der Industrie gilt eine Ladeleistung oberhalb von 150 kW als HPC-Laden (High-Power-Charging). Was steckt hinter den Begriffen CPO, MSP und Ladestation? CPO: ""Charge Point Operator"" = Betreiber von Ladestationen; MSP: ""Mobility Service Provider"" = Dienst zum Laden via Karte/App an Stationen verschiedener CPOs; Ladestation: Gerät zum Versorgen von E-Autos mit Strom (meist mit mehreren Ladepunkten) Wie die meisten E-Auto-Besitzer laden Die Aussagekraft zur Qualität des Ladens in Deutschland ist laut dieser Untersuchung dennoch begrenzt, denn mehr als die Hälfte aller Ladevorgänge von E-Autos in Deutschland finden im privaten Bereich oder am Arbeitsplatz statt. Laut Energieagentur DENA wurden hierzulande mehr als 900.000 Wallboxen installiert, die das Ladeangebot ergänzen. In Großstädten wird seltener zu Hause geladen Eben in Ballungsgebieten, so die Sonderauswertung des jüngsten KfW-Energiewendebarometers, seien bei einem weiteren zahlenmäßigen Anstieg der Elektrofahrzeuge höhere Nutzungsraten zu erwarten.

Mit unter 4,40 Meter Außenlänge so kurz wie mancher Kompaktwagen, verführen seine Allrounder-Gene zu einem strapaziösen Doppelleben. Unter der Woche von 7 bis 16 Uhr im Gewerbeeinsatz, danach und an Wochenenden als günstiges Familienauto. Und genau das geht nach ein paar Jahren ganz schön an die Substanz. Unser im Juni 2016 erstmals zugelassener Testwagen stammt aus der von 2015 bis 2018 gebauten zweiten Facelift-Generation des Berlingo II . Vom Autohus in Bockel bei Bremen angeboten, ist er ein durchaus typisches Beispiel. In Dänemark auf die Straße gekommen, kostete er laut Schwacke-Datenbank neu einst 22.230 Euro. Citroën Berlingo gebraucht: nach sieben Jahren für knapp 8000 Euro Inklusive Feel-Ausstattung wirkt er zwar nicht luxuriös, hat aber alles Wesentliche an Bord: Neben einem einfachen Soundsystem mit Bluetooth-Anschluss gibt es elektrische Fensterheber, eine manuelle Klimaanlage, einen Tempomaten und Sitzheizungen vorn. Unser Fotofahrzeug spulte bereits 141.361 Kilometer ab, soll dafür gemessen am Baujahr moderate 7980 Euro kosten. Besonders viel Liebe erfuhr es in seinem ersten Autoleben offensichtlich nicht. Rundherum finden sich zahlreiche kleinere Dellen und Blessuren durch unachtsame Rangiervorgänge. Besonders ins Auge fällt die Stoßfängerecke hinten rechts, die ihrem Namen alle Ehre macht (Ersatz kostet 275 Euro). Außerdem fehlt eine Radkappe (das Ersatzteil gibt's für 50 Euro). Zoom Nüchternes Cockpit ohne Infotainment-Ambitionen. Hoch liegender Schaltknauf, leicht bedienbar. Bild: Christoph Börries / AUTO BILD Der Innenraum mit seinen robusten Stoffen hat sich besser gehalten. Deutlich abgegriffen ist nur der Lenkradkranz, jedoch sind viele Kunststoffoberflächen verschmutzt. Für ein besseres Wohlgefühl empfehlen wir eine gründliche Aufbereitung beim Profi. Und jenseits kosmetischer Probleme? Da gibt es immer noch gute Gründe, sich für einen Berlingo II zu interessieren. Denn beim Thema Nutzwert macht dem Franzosen so schnell keiner etwas vor. Das Platzangebot auf den weich gepolsterten Sitzen in den Reihen eins und zwei ist voll familientauglich. Entspannend für den Alltag mit Kind und Kegel wirkt, dass es Ablagen und Staufächer in Hülle und Fülle gibt. Das Laderaumabteil ist das eigentliche Highlight: Es nimmt notfalls ganze Euro-Paletten auf und ist grob doppelt so groß wie das in durchschnittlichen Kompakt-Kombis. Dank zweckmäßiger Oberflächen ist sich der Berlingo außerdem für fast nichts zu schade. Dieselmotor wirtschaftlicher als die durstigen Benziner Berlingo an den Haken nehmen. Eine positive Überraschung ist der 1 ,6 Liter große HDi-Motor. Der 99 PS starke Euro-6-Commonrail-Turbodiesel hat einen SCR-Kat und erfüllt die Abgasnorm Euro 6. Durch sein ordentliches Drehmoment fährt er sich angenehmer und zugleich wirtschaftlicher als die durstigen Benziner-Versionen. Zur Not hat er genügend Kraft für mittelgroße Anhänger, bis 1300 Kilogramm darf der stets frontgetriebenean den Haken nehmen.

While this may be a source of frustration for EV drivers, the Government has decided that it is time to start collecting tax from electric cars, with around 1.3 million people believed to drive one in the UK. The tax-free status of EVs was not sustainable in the long term, reports Birmingham Live. With an increasing number of EVs on the roads each year, the Government risked losing significant amounts of tax revenue. Ministers argue that the change will make the tax system ""fair"" for all motorists. The change will affect all EVs. The Government stated: ""From April 1, 2025, drivers of electric and low-emission cars, vans and motorcycles will need to pay vehicle tax in the same way as drivers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles do. This change will apply to both new and existing vehicles and will ensure all drivers begin to pay a fairer tax contribution.

In the last few hours, Musk responded to two fans on X, asking Tesla to build bigger vehicles to support larger families. Musk often promotes the idea of having bigger families as he is afraid of declining populations due to low birth rates in some countries. With the first one, the CEO responded with a simple “OK,” and with the other, he elaborated a bit more by referencing the recently unveiled Tesla Robovan and “some other things”: Musk appears to be hinting at Tesla’s work on a bigger electric vehicle that has yet to be unveiled. While interesting, it’s hard to give too much weight to the comment, considering Musk claimed that Tesla has been working on a higher passenger capacity vehicle for years. A “high passenger-density urban transport” vehicle has been in Tesla’s official product roadmap since 2016 and has yet to be unveiled, unless you count the Robovan unveiled last month, but that’s completely attached to Tesla’s self-driving effort as the vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals. As part of Tesla’s shift toward autonomous driving, the automaker has pulled back plans for several new electric vehicle programs in favor of those without any driver inputs, like Cybercab and Robotvan. Musk has also discussed the possibility of Tesla making an electric van on several occasions in the last few years. Tesla is expected to soon unveil two new vehicles to be launch next year, but those are based on the Model 3 and Model Y and therefore, they aren’t likely to be bigger vehicles. Electrek’s Take Like most things Elon says lately, it goes in my “I’ll believe it when I see it” folder. That said, I think an electric van that can be configured for cargo, camper, or passenger, would make a ton of sense in Tesla’s vehicle lineup. Of course, it’s harder to get the greenlight for a vehicle program like that if your CEO is perpetually convinced that the company is on the verge of achieving self-driving and making steering wheels obsolete. I’m more of the opinion that Tesla should have played it more careful and continue working on growing its human-driveable EV lineup while working on self-driving.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article primarily offers a speculative insight into Tesla's potential interest in developing larger electric vehicles.

Tödlicher Tesla-Unfall wirft erneut Fragen zur Fahrzeugsicherheit auf,Ein tragischer Unfall in Toronto entfacht erneut die Diskussion um Teslas Sicherheitsstandards. Könnten elektrische Türmechanismen lebensgefährlich sein?,https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nach-toedlichem-crash-wachsende-kritik-an-teslas-sicherheitsstandards-27691275.html,,2024-11-18 14:44:00,AUTO BILD,,"Anscheinend noch keine Lehren aus der Vergangenheit gezogen: Bereits 2022 berichteten wir über Tesla-Modelle, die sich nach einem Unfall nicht zuverlässig öffnen ließen und Fahrern einen wahren Höllenritt bescherten. Nun ist es im kanadischen Toronto erneut zu einem schweren Unfall mit einem Tesla gekommen, bei dem vier Menschen ums Leben kamen. Der Vorfall ereignete sich im Oktober 2024 und wirft abermals Fragen zu den Sicherheitsmerkmalen der elektronischen Türmechanismen von Tesla-Fahrzeugen und anderen E-Autos auf. Tragödie in Kanada Angaben der kanadischen Zeitung ""Toronto Star"" zufolge war das Elektroauto der US-Marke mit hoher Geschwindigkeit gegen einen Betonpfeiler geprallt und in Flammen aufgegangen. Vier der fünf Insassen überlebten den Aufprall nicht. Für die einzige Überlebende begann ein wahres Martyrium: Wie die Zeitung berichtet, gestaltete sich ihre Rettung kompliziert. Sie konnte das Fahrzeug nicht verlassen, weil die elektronische Tür nicht funktionierte. Nur durch die Zivilcourage mehrerer Ersthelfer – die mit einer Metallstange die Scheibe des Fahrzeugs einschlugen – konnte die 25-Jährige aus den Flammen befreit werden. Wie gefährlich sind elektrische Türgriffe? Die versenkbaren Türgriffe von Tesla und anderen Premium-Automarken stellen laut ADAC ein massives Sicherheitsrisiko dar: Teilweise ließen sie sich nur über elektrische Stellmotoren betätigen, warnt der Automobilklub. So kann es passieren, dass Türgriffe eingefahren bleiben, wenn die Stromversorgung des Autos nach einem Unfall ausfällt – etwa wenn die Batterie in Brand geriet. Rettungskräfte können dadurch oft nicht rechtzeitig zu den Insassen vordringen. Der ADAC weist außerdem darauf hin, dass einige Pkw Türen von innen elektrisch per Knopfdruck entriegelten. Die dazugehörigen Schalter befänden sich aber nicht in jedem Fahrzeug an der gleichen Stelle und seien in vielen Fällen wenig intuitiv zu bedienen. Eine Kritik, die auch schon bei Tesla-Modellen geäußert wurde. Demnach sind die Hebel der Notentriegelung optisch nicht klar von der angrenzenden Abdeckung der Fensterheber zu unterscheiden. Autobesitzer, die ein Fahrzeug mit elektrischer Türöffnung von innen ihr Eigen nennen, sollten sich daher vor Fahrtbeginn in der Bedienungsanleitung mit der Notentriegelung vertraut machen – und diese am besten auch Beifahrern zeigen. Im Fall des tragischen Unfalls in Kanada untersuchen die Behörden derzeit, ob das Versagen des Türmechanismus tatsächlich dazu beigetragen hat, dass die Insassen nicht aus dem brennenden E-Auto entkommen konnten.

Lindner mit Kehrtwende beim Porsche-Verkauf,Seinen Job als Finanzminister ist er gerade erst los. Seinen Dienstwagen auch.

Hintergrund: Mit dem Job in der Regierung verliert Lindner auch seinen Dienstwagen. ""Der ist weg. Jetzt brauche ich das alte Auto doch"", erklärt der FDP-Chef auf X. Dazu postet er ein Foto, das ihn in einer Berliner S-Bahn zeigt. ""Gedankenspiele beendet"", schreibt Lindner mit einem lachenden Smiley. Dabei hatte er noch vor ein paar Wochen im Gespräch mit dem ""F.A.Z.-Magazin"" verraten: ""Ich bin so langsam offen für etwas anderes.""

If you don't have a lot of room to store a full-size bike or need to tuck it away once you reach the office, these portable bikes collapse into a neat package. And like the best electric bikes, folding ebikes come equipped with a motor and battery to assist as you cycle. The folding design means that they have a slightly lower range, but the best foldable electric bike is one you'll actually use, so it needs to fit into your requirements and lifestyle. But with so many models out there with similar specifications, it can be hard to know how they fare until you ride them. That's why we've taken the best folding electric bikes for a ride to see how they fare in the real world. We found that the Aventon Sinch.2 is the best folding electric bike for most people as its versatile and easy to use. But if you're after a more budget-friendly option, the Ride1Up Portola is an excellent choice. And we've rounded up all our favorite foldable e-bikes across a range of styles, budgets and uses. The quick list The best folding electric bikes you can buy today Why you can trust Tom's Guide Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you. Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate. Best folding electric bike overall (Image credit: Tom's Guide) 1. Aventon Sinch.2 Best folding electric bike overall Our expert review: Specifications Weight: 68 pounds Motor: 500W, 48V rear hub motor Battery: 48V, 14Ah Folded dimensions: 20 x 24 x 32 inches Today's Best Deals Check Amazon View at Aventon Reasons to buy + Great handling for a bike with small wheels and short wheelbase + Looks great + Good for taller riders Reasons to avoid - Suspension fork is too soft and largely unnecessary - Expensive The Aventon Sinch.2 is a durable, stable, quick-folding electric bike that'll suit quick commutes and longer rides. We were particularly impressed with its stability, especially for a foldable bike, and the build quality. The rear-mounted motor can assist you up to 20mph, while the 20-inch wheels and 4-inch tires mean that the Aventon Sinch.2 can handle most everyday terrains with relative ease. Aventon focuses on the essentials, so the bike can do the basics well, but if you want to carry larger loads, you can pick up additional accessories to expand the bike's storage. However, the base bike is pretty expensive as it is, so these extras quickly add up. But if you're looking for a solid folding bike that can handle the majority of your daily routine, the Sinch.2 is an excellent option. Our only complaint is that we found the suspension fork was a bit too soft for our liking. But, you can easily switch this out for a more rigid fork if you're inclined, though this will, of course, add to the overall cost.

Ride1Up Portola Best budget foldable ebike Our expert review: Specifications Weight: 59 pounds Motor: 750W, 48V sustained, rear hub Battery: 48V, 104Ah or 48V, 13.4Ah Folded dimensions: 19 x 29.5 33 inches Today's Best Deals View at Ride1UP View at Ride1UP View Black Friday at Amazon Reasons to buy + Powerful motor + Nimble yet stable ride + Good battery life + Fits riders of various heights easily Reasons to avoid - Hinge squeaks during riding - Strap that secures the two halves when folded is too short If you're looking for a more budget-friendly foldable ebike, then the Ride1Up Portola is a great option. It combines an excellent ride with a sleek and versatile design, which is impressive for the almost $1,000 price tag. You get a choice of two battery options; 10.4Ah and 13.4Ah, although you pay an extra $100 for the larger size. The bike folds at the center, and it gets pretty compact — just 36 inches long and 16 inches wide. Plus, the handlebars collapse at the touch of a lever too. Like with many of these foldable ebikes, we found that the front suspension was unscary, didn't add much to the ride, and just added weight to the bike. But that was our only major complaint, as the bike offered plenty of power, even on hill starts. For such a small bike, the motor packs a powerful punch, and was able to tackle almost any situation we put it to. If we had one small criticism, it's that Ride1Up could make the hinge level quieter, but that doesn't stop it being a fantastic budget-conscious folding electric bike.

Lectric XP 3.0 Best foldable ebike for comfort Our expert review: Specifications Weight: 64 pounds Motor: 500W hub motor Battery: 48V Li-Ion Folded dimensions: 18 x 28 x 37 inches Today's Best Deals View at Best Buy (Black) View at Lectric eBikes Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Powerful motor kicks in quickly when pedaling or using the throttle + Fun, comfortable ride + Lots of accessory options Reasons to avoid - Suspension fork is unnecessary and a bit clunky - Folding and unfolding process could be easier If you're after comfort without compromising on power, it's worth considering the Lectric XP 3.0. It's not quite as fun to ride as the Ride1Up Portula, but it comes close. It can handle hill starts and speedy commutes with ease using the right settings. We found that the ride was incredibly responsive, which did take some getting used to, but once you're out of any swooping corners, the motor kicks back in as soon as you start pedaling again, though it was tough to get the bike to actually hit the 20mph max assist speed. The bike was comfortable, even on extended rides, but we did feel that the seat was too large and ended up getting in the way, even when folded. The folding mechanism was intuitive, but the hinge was on the stiff side, making it difficult to engage with cold hands in winter. You can upgrade the base model with accessory packs, like the Comfort kit, which includes a larger seat. However, even without the extras, the Lectric XP 3.0 is a speedy, long-lasting, and comfortable option for rides around the city and to the office and back.

Brompton C-Line Explore Best lightweight foldable ebike Our expert review: Specifications Weight: 32 pounds Motor: 250W hub motor Battery: 300Wh, 36V Folded dimensions: 10.6 x 23 x 25.3 inches Today's Best Deals View Black Friday at Amazon View at Brompton Reasons to buy + Looks cool + Folds up easily + Removable battery offers versatility + Fun to ride Reasons to avoid - Wheels are too small and narrow for rougher roads - Very expensive for limited features The C-Line Explore looks a lot like Brompton's other bikes, but if you're a fan of the company's minimal aesthetic, then you'll find plenty to like with this folding electric bike. It's a breeze to ride, has good range, and folds into a nicely compact package for storage. Plus, we liked the attention to detail in the design, like adding a USB port for charging your phone. And, if you want to reduce the weight and take a manual cycle, you can quickly remove the battery for unassisted rides. It's a great package if you're looking for a commuting bike, but there are some trade-offs. The C-Line Explore easily folds to make it compact for storage, with small wheels designed to reduce its footprint. But these smaller wheels make it harder to stay in control across uneven roads, so you may be better with the larger wheels of the Aventon Sinch.2 on rougher terrain. However, it excels as a lightweight commuter bike for city rides. We were impressed with the battery's almost 50-mile range, and how neatly the bike folds away to make it easy to store beside your desk at work or discreetly placed behind the couch at home. Read our full Brompton C-Line Explore review Best folding electric bike for rough terrain (Image credit: Tom's Guide) The Heybike Mars 2.0 isn't the most elegant ebike around, but the fat-tired wheels make it an ideal option for uneven ground or rougher terrain. Plus, there's a large rear rack for carrying cargo and it comes in four colors if you want to add some personality to your bike. It's the follow-up to the company's first folding bike, the Mars, and the upgrades here are relatively modest, as you get a bit more power and a slightly longer-lasting battery. And it retains the first-generation's center-folding lever-based mechanism for quick storage. However, we found that, while the motor is powerful enough to see you through most situations (even steep hills), there's a noticeable lag between when you start to pedal and when the motor kicks in, which we didn't experience on the other folding electric bikes in this guide. But once you've adjusted to this delay, the Mars 2.0 is an extremely fun bike to ride, even on rough or snow-covered roads. So, if you're after a durable, solid folding ebike for your next adventure, it's worth adding to your shortlist.

Rad Power RadExpand 5 Best compact foldable ebike Our expert review: Specifications Weight: 62.5 pounds Motor: 750W geared hub motor Battery: 672W Folded dimensions: 25 x 29 x 41 inches Today's Best Deals View Black Friday at Amazon View at Radpower Reasons to buy + Powerful and quick-engaging motor + Easy to fold + More compact than most of its competitors, especially when folded Reasons to avoid - Expensive compared to its folding ebike peers Rad Power makes some of the best electric bikes, but many are packed with premium features and a price tag to match. The RadExpand 5 takes a more back-to-basics approach in the best possible way and adds a quick, easy-to-use folding mechanism for storage. It feels like a foldable electric bike, rather than an electric bike you can fold with fewer unnecessary features like a suspension fork, which adds weight for minimal performance gain on these compact ebikes. It might be smaller than RadPower's other models but it still has plenty of power. We also quite liked that the pedals don't fold. This sounds counterintuitive, but folding pedals make the process more complicated for very minimal space savings, and it's more time consuming to unfold when all you want to do is hop and your bike and get riding. However, it's also significantly more expensive than the other folding electric bikes we've included, and it feels like it's missing several features at this price, like a handlebar-mounted cycling computer, for example. Still, it's extremely versatile, powerful, and fun to ride. Read our full Rad Power RadExpand 5 review How to choose the best folding electric bike Start your search for the best electric folding bike by examining the basic specs and comparing them against how you intend to use the bike. For example, if you have a long commute, you’ll want to make sure you choose a bike with a long advertised range so you can make it to work and back with battery life to spare. And consider the terrain on which you’re most likely to ride. While many folding ebikes today come stock with wide tires that can handle dirt roads and rough pavement, others come with narrower tires that might not be suitable for rougher terrain. But, narrower tires also mean more compact folding. And those skinnier tires save weight, so if you’ll be stowing your ebike in an overhead space, pay close attention to the bike’s overall weight and err toward skinny tires. And if your priority is space savings, skinnier tires help a ton. How we test the best folding electric bikes We rode each bike in this guide extensively to gauge ride quality, usability, versatility, battery life, and motor power. For some of the bikes that claim a wide rider height range, we asked a much taller friend (over 6 feet tall) to test the bikes for their handling capabilities and size accommodations. Since folding ebikes tend to be compact, the bike’s handling can be affected. During testing, we paid particular attention to how the bike responds to different steering situations — from tight corners to high-speed sweeping curves. The best folding ebikes handle both with ease or at least limit any steering unsteadiness to the least common steering scenarios. While all of those factors are important in any ebike, folding ebikes must also be critiqued on their foldability. How small does it fold up? How light is it? Can the rider easily carry it in the folded position? How quick and easy is it to fold, and to unfold for riding use? Build quality matters, too. Since folding ebikes have hinges, those hinged locations must remain solid and stable while you’re riding the bike. Quick-release levers should engage tightly, and there should be little to no play in any part that releases for folding. The bulk of the testing took place on rolling terrain in Colorado. Almost all of it was on paved surfaces, or through patches of dirt and grass for brief periods. Temperatures ranged from 25 degrees Fahrenheit to 65 degrees Fahrenheit; colder temperatures can have an adverse effect on battery life. Each bike was tested for motor response (how long it takes for the assist to kick in once you start pedaling); throttle response; starting from a dead stop on a hill; battery life under heavy use; foldability and storability; and basic functionality. FAQs How do you fold a folding bike? Folding bikes, whether motorized or not, feature hinges placed strategically to allow you to fold the bike up to a compact size. There’s usually a large hinge on the main tube of the frame. The hinge is locked in place with a lever that can be released to allow the folding movement. Most folding ebikes also include a hinge or hinges placed on the stem, which is usually a very long structural piece that allows for a comfortable riding position. Levers once again lock the hinge in place, and when disengaged, allow for the folding movement that makes the bike compact. The best folding ebikes feature some sort of locking mechanism to keep the halves of the bike secured to each other when folded. This makes it much easier to move the bike in the folded position. Are folding bikes harder to ride? Folding electric bikes aren’t harder to ride than any other type of bicycle, but there is a learning curve when you ride one for the first time. Because the wheelbase of a folding ebike tends to be quite short, the bike’s handling may feel odd to some riders. This is especially the case for taller riders who may find themselves feeling cramped on these compact bikes. But once you get a feel for the reactivity of the steering, a folding ebike is no more challenging to ride than any other bicycle. What is the disadvantage of a folding bike? While folding electric bikes can be a convenient and space-saving way to get around, they won't be right for everyone. The folding mechanism, and the materials needed to ensure its stability and durability, means that folding bikes are generally heavier than their non-folding counterparts. This is more of an issue on non-electric bikes though. All electric bikes are heavier than push bikes as they have batteries and motors, so the additional weight from the folding mechanism is less noticeable. Similarly, the weight of a regular bike is more important as a heavier bike requires more power to move. The motors on electric bikes are designed to alleviate this, but it does mean that you could see a reduction in battery life on a foldable vs non-foldable bike. And because the bike needs to be able to fold, there's less space for a large battery. So some folding e-bikes have lower battery life than non-foldable models to begin with. But, if you want to use the bike for fixed-distance commutes or trips into town, you should be able to plan around this. Are folding bikes useful for carrying cargo? Some folding ebikes come with rear racks onto which you can mount baskets and other accessories. And many come with mounting points for a front rack as well. This makes the folding electric bike more useful if you have items you want to carry, but adding these accessories makes the bike larger and bulkier, and, ultimately, more difficult to store in the folded position. How do I know if a folding bike is right for me? If you're considering an electric bike and are trying to work out if you need a foldable ebike, it depends on how and where you want to travel. As they collapse to save space, foldable bikes are a great option if you live in an apartment or are tight on space. But outside of home, folding ebikes are a good choice if you need to get on another form of transport like a bus, train or subway. But if you want to cycle to the store and pick up groceries, you'll be better off with a larger cargo bike. And folding electric bikes are generally less comfortable for taller riders. Are folding ebikes heavy? Generally, a folding ebike will be heavier than a non-motorized folding bike. That can limit how and where you use your bike, and how and where you store it. Many of the bikes in this test weigh upwards of 50 pounds or more, which limits overhead storage for most users. If that’s a concern, consider something like Brompton’s C-Line, which is much lighter and smaller than every bike in the test. Removing the battery also makes it even lighter. It can be ridden as a non-motorized bike too. Of course, for the lightest option, go with a non-motorized folding bike. Do folding ebikes have different batteries and motors than full-size ebikes? All the folding ebikes in our test use batteries and motors with a similar size and power profile as full-size ebikes. Since folding ebikes generally fold at the center point on the frame, that limits the type of motors they can use. For instance, a folding ebike probably can’t incorporate a mid-drive motor; instead, it will use a rear-hub or front-hub motor. What is the difference between a Class 2 and Class 3 ebike? There are three electric bike classifications in the U.S. — Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. The main difference between the levels is the top assisted speed and if you need to pedal to get the motor to kick in. Class 1 ebikes only assist when you pedal and reach a top speed of 20mph. Meanwhile, Class 2 electric bikes have the same 20mph top speed, but have a throttle to power the bike without pedaling. Class 3 bikes are allowed to reach a maximum speed of 28mph, but can only assist when you're pedaling.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article centers around folding electric bikes, presenting multiple options and reviews but lacks genuine originality or unique insights on new trends, technologies, or innovations in the electric vehicle industry.

Future of roads minister Lilian Greenwood said: “Zero emission vehicles will drive our journey to net zero, which is why this Government is committed to accelerating the transition. Ensuring consumers have clear, accurate information when deciding what kind of car to buy is essential. This work by industry is absolutely vital to boosting drivers’ confidence in zero emission vehicles, and I’m pleased to back it.” Following a House of Lords report calling for a “go-to” source of reliable information on EVs, Auto Trader’s April research revealed significant gaps between perception and reality. Its findings showed that 72% of consumers were aware of the false narrative that EVs are prone to fires, with 44% believing it to be true. Additionally, 70% of consumers had heard that EVs are not cost-effective, with 33% mistakenly agreeing, which has discouraged some from considering EVs. Retailers echo these sentiments, with only 35% stocking EVs, showing a halt in growth after a substantial increase in 2022. A significant 46% of retailers also cited consumer doubts as a barrier to adoption. Even so, 83% of current EV owners reported they would choose electric again, indicating high satisfaction among users. Erin Baker, editorial director at Auto Trader, commented: “Electrification is a significant change and with change comes uncertainty and confusion and that’s why we’re trying to help share more balanced and fact-based narratives with both retailers and consumers to give everyone confidence to navigate their electric journey. “Often this comes down to the fear of the unknown and this is clear when consumers tell us how much they love their electric cars.

The report said the electric vehicle chargers in the Tenbury Road car park, which are the only public chargers listed in the town on Zapmap, are currently out of service. ALSO READ: ""BP Pulse has advised us that, due to their age, these units can no longer be repaired,"" the report said. ""Upgrading the chargers has been a goal for some time, though securing the necessary power supply has presented challenges. However, we are actively exploring solutions to address these issues and hope to be able to have faster chargers installed at this location in the future."" Upgrading the current chargers, which are BP Pulse 7kw chargers, has long been on the agenda for Bromyard and Winslow Town Council. Back in 2022, the council's properties committee heard from the properties officer that the current chargers are ""very slow"" and that use had increased significantly, with locals and visitors requesting more suitable charging.

In October that year, minutes reveal, the council was in talks with two EV charging companies and two proposals were to be considered. But by September 2023, there was still no movement on the chargers, with committee minutes revealing that the need to upgrade the existing transformer and high voltage network would need a ""significant investment"" of around £250,000, plus £400,000 covered by National Grid, due to the distance from the mains to the car park. ""Until such time as the grid network reinforcement works are commissioned, Swarco is unable to proceed any further with the project,"" the minutes said.

Established in 1945, Tata Motors’ diverse portfolio includes an extensive range of cars, sport utility vehicles, trucks, buses and defence vehicles. Jaguar and Land Rover; the two prestigious British car brands were acquired by Tata back in 2008. Tata launched the Tata Indica in 1998; its first passenger car in India, which paved the way for the future models to come. Tata (Telco back then) was also responsible for bringing the three-pointed star (Mercedes-Benz) to India in 1995. Product portfolio Hatchback: Tata’s hatchbacks’ portfolio ranges from the Tiago to the Altroz. Micro SUV: Tata offers the Punch as an entry-level micro SUV. It takes on the Mahindra KUV100 NXT and Maruti Ignis but due to its price, it also rivals the Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger. Sub-compact SUV: The Tata Nexon represents Tata in one of the most competitive SUV segments in the industry where it goes up against the likes of Kia Sonet, Maruti Vitara Brezza and Hyundai Venue. EV: Tata ventured into the personal EV space with the Nexon EV which was then followed by the Tigor EV. Mid-size SUV: With underpinnings derived from the Land Rover division, Tata offers the Tata Harrier and the Tata Safari as competitors to the mid-size 5-seater SUV segment and three-row SUV space, respectively. Sedan: Successor to the Tata Zest, Tata Tigor is a sub-4 metre sedan offered by Tata which rivals the Hyundai Aura, Maruti Dzire, and Honda Amaze. Greatest Hits Tata’s top products in India have been: Tata Safari: First made-in-India 4WD SUV, popular for its bold looks and off-road capabilities. Tata Nano: At the time of launch, the Tata Nano was priced at Rs 1 lakh, making it the most affordable production car in the world.

It was also the most affordable diesel powered vehicle when it was launched in 1998 Tata Sumo: A rugged utility vehicle, Tata Sumo was the go-to car capable of taking on rural territories with ease. Future Plans Tata has shown great zeal towards electrification of its portfolio, as it’s the only brand with two electric vehicles available in the market at the moment.

"If you haven’t been car shopping in a while, brace yourself","The market is abandoning the below-$35,000 price point.” There are also more electric vehicles, as well as growing demand for hybrids, both of which are more expensive than traditional gas-only ...",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/16/business/50k-car-prices/index.html,,2024-11-16 15:08:00,CNN,,"New York CNN — It’s called sticker shock. And if you haven’t been to a dealer’s showroom since before the pandemic, you might want to prepare yourself. Americans paid a whopping $47,612 on average for a new car in October, according to data from Edmunds. That’s a jump of almost $10,000 from October 2019, ahead of the pandemic. That means new car prices have risen much faster than most goods and services. The price jump has multiple origin stories: The pandemic snarled supply chains and limited essential car parts. Buyers increasingly prefer larger cars with more features, continuing the decades-long shift to bigger, more expensive SUVs and trucks. But much of the reason Americans are paying nearly $50k for a car is that automakers decided to go all-in on expensive cars. The more they charge for a car, the more money they make off it. “You’d be hard pressed to find anything under $30,000 from an American automaker,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. “They’re hacking away at models altogether, and basic trim levels, which are no longer the bulk of the business. They’re raising the floor prices.” You want features, you got ‘em Today’s cars come with all manner of driver assist features, including automatic braking, adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning systems. “People didn’t know they wanted them (these features) until they had them,” said Charlie Chesbrough, economist and senior director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. “It’s a mix of what consumers want, and what industry is moving to. The market is abandoning the below-$35,000 price point.” There are also more electric vehicles, as well as growing demand for hybrids, both of which are more expensive than traditional gas-only cars. The cheaper cars remaining are generally from foreign brands. The average price of a Nissan sold in the United States in the third quarter stood at $35,362, and that includes sales of its luxury Infiniti brand. Cars are hard to find – but not SUVs The traditional Big Three of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which sells under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands, have virtually abandoned the sedan market to focus almost entirely on SUVs and pickups. Ford sells only one traditional “car” these days, the Mustang, a two-door coupe rather than a family sedan. The last non-SUV or pickup Chevrolet will roll off the line this month. The exclusion of almost everything that isn’t a big, high-riding crossover or SUV has already raised the average sales price to $50,922 at GM, $54,963 at Stellantis and $55,632 at Ford. While average prices are down $142 from a year ago, they could be heading higher soon. That’s because high interest rates have kept prices in check the past couple years, Drury said. With the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to a two-decade high to battle inflation, buyers had to spend more on their car loan payments. Now that rates are coming down, that frees up cash to spend on pricey features instead. The average rate on a new car loan – 7% in October – is well above what it was early in the pandemic. The combination of higher interest rates and higher car prices, along with the biggest average loans ever taken out to buy them, lifted the average monthly car payment to $742 in October. “The only thing that stopped it from getting any higher is interest rates,” Drury said. “If money was a bit cheaper, we’d be hitting $50,000 probably around now,” he said. “If they can buy more car rather than spending more on financing, they’re going to do it.” Tariffs could also raise prices And prices could head even higher if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to impose steep tariffs on imports, especially in the the auto sector. Details remain scarce, but even if tariffs are limited to finished cars, it could raise prices for cars built at US factories by reducing competition from lower-priced foreign models, said Jeff Schuster, global vice president of automotive research at consultant GlobalData. In addition, many of the less expensive models available in US showrooms are imported here, from factories overseas or in Mexico. And it is possible the tariffs could also be slapped on auto parts. And that would make every car built in America more expensive, because no vehicle is made with 100% American parts. “Those costs will be passed onto car buyers. They’re not going to be absorbed by the automakers or suppliers,” he said.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article mainly focuses on the upward trend in car prices, emphasizing the role of larger vehicles and additional features in this increase.

Volkswagen, meanwhile, admitted it might be forced to cut thousands of staff, as well as reduce salaries and potentially close factories in Germany due to a slump in sales across the board. Fiat has also temporarily stopped production of its 500e at its Turin plant. The Autoblog has listed every car due to disappear in 2025, including the top 5 performance motors. JAGUAR F-TYPE In July, a company spokesperson for Jaguar Land Rover announced that production of the XE, XF and F-Type sportscar had finished. What's more, the small E-Pace SUV and the I-Pace EV, which are both produced at their Austrian facility, will no longer be produced from December 2024. However, one model, the F-Pace, will see its production run extended into 2025. Jaguar Land Rover's CEO Adrian Mardell revealed at an investor’s day earlier this year that the manufacturer is fully committed to becoming a luxury, all-electric brand. In a statement to Top Gear, Jaguar said: ""As JLR transitions to its electric future, current Jaguar production of XE, XF and F-Type came to an end in mid 2024, while the I-Pace and E-Pace in partnership with Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria will come to an end in December 2024.

ALFA ROMEO GIULIA QUADRIFOGLIO & STELVIO QUADRIFOGLIO These two high performance twins are also for the chop. The Giulia Quadrifoglio has always thrilled among the sports sedans with its twin-turbo V6.

The Supra will only have the 3.0-litre six-cylinder going forward, but with its sibling's departure, car lovers will have even fewer affordable lightweight sports cars to choose from. AMAZING TIME TO BUY ELECTRIC The electric market is currently in a slump as manufacturers slash prices with record discounts. Carmakers are scrambling to up their zero-emission sales to comply with increasingly tightening Net Zero laws. The new Government has confirmed it will reinstate the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 after former PM Rishi Sunak delayed it to 2025. Plenty of firms have already self-imposed earlier deadlines to make the all-electric transition in an attempt to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, Jaguar won't sell a new car in the UK for a whole year as bosses prepare to phase out petrol power altogether in 2026. But every brand is still subject to the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. The legally-binding regulations force manufacturers to ensure that a certain portion of their sales are electric vehicles, with the percentage increasing each year up to the total ban. This year's requirement is 22%, with firms fined up to £1,500 per car they produce over the limit. Already, bosses at Ford have said they will have to make fewer petrol models to balance their stats. However, others are trying to get the EVs flying out the doors by slapping them with heavy discounts. DS, the luxury arm of Citroen, is leading the way, with an average drop of 35.7% on the 3 Crossback. That means that new models are cut from over £37,000 to under £25,000, according to data from AutoTrader. MG isn't far behind with a 34% dip for the 5 and 30% for the ZS. Even Tesla, which isn't bound by the Mandate since it only makes EVs, has dropped the Model 3 from £42,000 to £39,000 in the past year. Ian Plummer, commercial director at AutoTrader, commented: ""That sort of discount finally makes it possible for the consumer to make a rational decision to buy an EV, rather than base it on emotional reasons such as environmental factors. ""It’s going to be very painful [for manufacturers]. ""They are going to be selling EVs at a loss in many cases and they will have to arbitrage those losses with the profits they can still make on their diesel and petrol vehicles."" The only issue is that EVs remain stubbornly more expensive on average than their petrol counterparts, despite the discounts. This is largely to do with the costs associated with developing brand new electric platforms, rather than re-using already established internal combustion specs. As a result, brands can only cut prices so much to stimulate demand before losses become unsustainable. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry body the SMMT, explained: ""The ZEV mandate compels manufacturers to produce, but it does not compel consumers to buy.""",Business,bing,"The article offers a mix of current industry happenings and impacts due to the shift towards electric vehicles, including details on classic cars being phased out and recent market trends.

Best Electric Toothbrushes of 2024,Caroline Igo (she/her/hers) is a wellness editor and holds Sleep Science Coach and Stress Management certificates from the Spencer Institute. She received her bachelor's degree in creative writing ...,https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/best-electric-toothbrush/,,2024-11-15 20:13:00,CNET,,"The electric toothbrushes in this section weren't my favorites, but they do have some great qualities worth mentioning. One of these might be the right choice for you so it felt worthwhile to include them here. Philips Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush For ages 3 and up, the Philips Sonicare for Kids is just as great as Philips' other Sonicare models. The electric brush has two different modes and a brush timer and comes in two different colors. Plus, each box contains stickers to decorate the handle. It functions very similarly to the Oral-B Kid's Electric Toothbrush, although the brush head vibrates instead of oscillating. I did notice that the handle is heavier and about an inch longer than that of the Oral-B Kid's Color Changing toothbrush. The brush head is a smaller version of the Philips Sonicare Prestige but is still almost three times longer than the Oral-B Kid's brush head. What makes the Sonicare for Kids brush unique is that it has Bluetooth capabilities that connect to a smartphone app. I think the app is one of the best; it has educational videos and a tracking system that parents can use to see their kids' brushing behavior. Quip Electric Toothbrush The Quip brush head is very close to the size of a manual toothbrush head. The Quip is simple in every aspect: It has one speed and a two-minute timer that buzzes every 30 seconds and turns off once the time is up. That's it. There's no app, charger or wires. This electric toothbrush is powered by an AAA battery located in the handle and the charge lasts three months. I gave the Hum by Colgate the ""best battery-powered electric toothbrush"" title and not the Quip because I didn't like the brush head of the toothbrush. Yes, it's similar to a manual toothbrush but I found it hard to use to reach around my mouth. I also noticed that Quip's motor isn't very powerful compared with models from Sonicare or Oral-B. To me, it felt just like a manual cleaning. I didn't like that, but others may not mind. If you're looking for a smart electric toothbrush without Bluetooth or an app, the Quip may be the one. CariPro Electric Toothbrush The CariPro is a good brush, it just didn't compare to the others on this list. The brush head vibrates and the top and bottom of the brush flare outward. My gums and teeth felt sensitive after using the CariPro, but I do tend to experience dental sensitivity. It is hard to say if it was due to the brush bristles or the way the brush head flared out. If you have sensitive gums, note that the brush has five settings and one of which is a sensitive one. There's some good in this: I feel like the CariPro did a good job of cleaning my mouth. Y-Brush The Y-Brush turned heads and piqued interest at CES in 2017 and came back to CES year after year. The strange, Y-shaped brush claims that it can brush all of your teeth in just 10 seconds. After applying toothpaste directly on the brush, the entire Y-Brush goes into your mouth. You then must bite down and press the button to activate the gentle vibrations. After five seconds, you can move to your lower set of teeth. I not only found that the Y-Brush didn't clean my teeth but the vibrations hurt my head. It was an uncomfortable experience that left my teeth just coated in toothpaste. The concept of this brush is fun and interesting. It might be for you if you are tired of ordinary electric toothbrushes. Oral-B Pro 500 Precision Clean My experience with the Oral-B Pro 500 Precision Clean brush compared with some others in the same price range. It has one cleaning mode and the brush head oscillates and rotates on a two-minute timer. The brush alerts you when you are finished. This simple Oral-B brush is basic and doesn't have any special technology or paired apps. Out of all the Oral-B brushes I tested with rotating spin heads, I liked this one the least. It wasn't as powerful as the others and after a few uses, I found myself wondering if I needed a new brush head. I think this brush is perfect for someone testing out an electric toothbrush for the first time. It is simple and very reasonably priced. I would personally choose the Oral-B Pro 1000, but this Pro 500 is a good budget option.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article is not related to electric vehicles or any aspects pertaining to the EV industry.

Your Guide to All-Electric Vehicle Charging,"New EVs like the Acura ZDX are changing the game. Here's the 411 on choosing the right car, charging tech, and installation plan.",https://www.menshealth.com/technology-gear/a62919983/your-guide-to-all-electric-vehicle-charging/,,2024-11-15 19:00:00,Men's Health,,"Electric vehicles have come a long way since the first modern EVs hit the roads in the early 2000s. A combination of factors, including improved battery life, charging technology, and design, have drivers increasingly saying goodbye to gas tanks in favor of EVs, whether they live in small towns, suburbs, or cities. The Edison Electric Institute and the Institute for Electric Innovation, for example, project that 26.4 million EVs will be on U.S. roads by 2030. This increase in EV sales also means that charging technology has rapidly expanded and improved, now including home charging, portable charging, and public charging. If you’re thinking of introducing an EV to your garage, such as the all-electric Acura ZDX Type S, which has up to a 278 mile EPA Range Rating*, Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive with nearly 500-hp providing a smooth driving experience, and three charging packages suited to different lifestyles, it’s important to get acquainted with the technology that will power your car. Here’s everything you need to know about charging in order to go electric. Home Charging Home charging is ideal for drivers with high daily mileage or a strong preference for dedicated home infrastructure. This type of charger will usually be mounted on your wall and rely on a dedicated line to your electrical panel to charge your vehicle. This uses the most electricity, and thus usually requires hardwire installation—meaning you’ll have to connect it directly to your electrical system to account for the higher electrical demand—but it’s the fastest way to reach a full charge. Acura’s Home Charging Bundle includes a Home Charging Station that allows drivers to charge at their own convenience, a $500 AHE (Acura Home Electrification) installation credit that can assist with these set-up costs, and a $100 charging credit** on the EVgo charging network that can be used as a back-up when away from home. Acura The Acura ZDX Type S with the Acura Home Charging Station. Your home itself may dictate what’s possible in terms of installation, says Joel Worthington, the president of a nationwide electricity-services provider. ""Some older homes may need an electrical upgrade for the EV equipment, which can increase the installation time,” he says. “With newer homes, however, the EV installation can typically be installed in a few hours by an electrician."" In some cities, new homes are required to come with EV-charging capacity. Regardless, one thing’s for sure—any home installation should be done by professionals. “Hiring a licensed electrician with experience in the installation of EVs can simplify the process and help ensure that the charger will be set up safely,"" adds Marty Stadelmaier, EVP of customer service at a Colorado-based electric management company. The AHE credit in Acura’s Home Charging Bundle can help cover the cost of hiring a professional. Portable Charging Portable chargers are a great option for drivers who travel frequently, live in rental properties, or otherwise value flexibility. These will utilize existing outlets at your home or on the go, allowing for more flexible charging without requiring a full installation. The speed with which you can reach full charge with a portable model depends on the voltage of the outlet you’re using, so you may end up needing to upgrade the outlet itself if you want faster charging speeds; generally speaking, industrial-grade outlets are recommended. Acura’s Portable Charging Bundle includes a Portable Charging Kit, a $250 AHE installation credit to help cover those potential outlet upgrades, and a $300 charging credit** on the EVgo network. Acura The interior of the Acura ZDX Type S. Public Charging Public charging stations are great for city dwellers, frequent travelers, and those who are otherwise always on the go. They can also be used as a supplement to home charging or portable charging. Since these stations are already set up, they offer convenience and ease-of-use that’s hard to match, but they’re dependent on station availability. It’s important to note that you may need to plan ahead and schedule your charging sessions based on station proximity. Acura’s Public Charging Package offers a $750 charging credit** on the EVgo network, allowing you to tap into three levels of public charging stations, aptly named level one, two, and three (also known as DC fast chargers) in ascending order of voltage. Once you have a charging set-up that works for your lifestyle and usage patterns, you’ll be ready to introduce an electric vehicle to your garage and hit the road—wherever you’re going. *278 mile EPA Range Rating for Type S.

If you’re thinking of introducing an EV to your garage, such as the all-electric Acura ZDX Type S, which has up to a 278 mile EPA Range Rating*, Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive with nearly 500-hp providing a smooth driving experience, and three charging packages suited to different lifestyles, it’s important to get acquainted with the technology that will power your car. Here’s everything you need to know about charging in order to go electric. Home Charging Home charging is ideal for drivers with high daily mileage or a strong preference for dedicated home infrastructure. This type of charger will usually be mounted on your wall and rely on a dedicated line to your electrical panel to charge your vehicle. This uses the most electricity, and thus usually requires hardwire installation—meaning you’ll have to connect it directly to your electrical system to account for the higher electrical demand—but it’s the fastest way to reach a full charge. Acura’s Home Charging Bundle includes a Home Charging Station that allows drivers to charge at their own convenience, a $500 AHE (Acura Home Electrification) installation credit that can assist with these set-up costs, and a $100 charging credit** on the EVgo charging network that can be used as a back-up when away from home. Acura The Acura ZDX Type S with the Acura Home Charging Station. Your home itself may dictate what’s possible in terms of installation, says Joel Worthington, the president of a nationwide electricity-services provider. ""Some older homes may need an electrical upgrade for the EV equipment, which can increase the installation time,” he says. “With newer homes, however, the EV installation can typically be installed in a few hours by an electrician."" In some cities, new homes are required to come with EV-charging capacity. Regardless, one thing’s for sure—any home installation should be done by professionals. “Hiring a licensed electrician with experience in the installation of EVs can simplify the process and help ensure that the charger will be set up safely,"" adds Marty Stadelmaier, EVP of customer service at a Colorado-based electric management company. The AHE credit in Acura’s Home Charging Bundle can help cover the cost of hiring a professional. Portable Charging Portable chargers are a great option for drivers who travel frequently, live in rental properties, or otherwise value flexibility. These will utilize existing outlets at your home or on the go, allowing for more flexible charging without requiring a full installation. The speed with which you can reach full charge with a portable model depends on the voltage of the outlet you’re using, so you may end up needing to upgrade the outlet itself if you want faster charging speeds; generally speaking, industrial-grade outlets are recommended. Acura’s Portable Charging Bundle includes a Portable Charging Kit, a $250 AHE installation credit to help cover those potential outlet upgrades, and a $300 charging credit** on the EVgo network. Acura The interior of the Acura ZDX Type S. Public Charging Public charging stations are great for city dwellers, frequent travelers, and those who are otherwise always on the go. They can also be used as a supplement to home charging or portable charging. Since these stations are already set up, they offer convenience and ease-of-use that’s hard to match, but they’re dependent on station availability. It’s important to note that you may need to plan ahead and schedule your charging sessions based on station proximity. Acura’s Public Charging Package offers a $750 charging credit** on the EVgo network, allowing you to tap into three levels of public charging stations, aptly named level one, two, and three (also known as DC fast chargers) in ascending order of voltage. Once you have a charging set-up that works for your lifestyle and usage patterns, you’ll be ready to introduce an electric vehicle to your garage and hit the road—wherever you’re going. *278 mile EPA Range Rating for Type S. Use for comparison purposes only. Actual range will vary based on several factors, including temperature, terrain, battery age & condition, loading, use and maintenance. **Credits may be used on EVgo fast charging network and their roaming partners.",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article, 'Your Guide to All-Electric Vehicle Charging,' provides valuable insights and information for prospective electric vehicle (EV) owners, particularly focusing on the different types of charging solutions available.

Doch SUVs sind die beliebteste Autoklasse in Deutschland, deswegen wolle",https://insideevs.de/features/741102/%C3%BCbersicht-kleine-elektrosuvs-4meter30-l%C3%A4nge/,,2024-11-15 12:59:00,insideevs,,"Seit dem Redesign unserer Website ist die Übersicht über alle Elektro-SUVs auf dem Markt optisch nicht mehr wirklich attraktiv. Doch SUVs sind die beliebteste Autoklasse in Deutschland, deswegen wollen wir Ihnen wieder etwas Gleichwertiges bieten. Unsere alte Bilderstrecke enthielt über 80 Modelle – für eine Liste ist das zu viel. Daher haben wir uns entschlossen, die Übersicht in drei Teile aufzugliedern. Hier ist der erste Part mit den Modellen bis 4,30 Meter Länge; geordnet sind die Autos nach Länge. Los geht's! Dacia Spring Facelift (3,70 m) Der Dacia Spring erhielt im Sommer 2024 ein Facelift. Dabei änderte sich vor allem die Optik außen und innen, während Antriebe und Akkus gleich blieben. Das heißt: Nach wie vor schafft das Auto nicht mehr als 220 km. Auch die Crashsicherheit hat sich nicht erhöht – der Wagen erhielt im EuroNCAP-Test nur einen einzigen Stern, und das nach den Standards von 2021. Immerhin sind die Preise ähnlich günstig wie früher. Sie beginnen nun bei 16.900 Euro; damit ist der Wagen nach wie vor das günstigste Elektroauto auf dem Markt (wenn man Leichtfahrzeuge à la Opel Rocks Electric ausnimmt). Basispreis: 16.900 Euro Frontantrieb mit 33 bzw. 48 kW 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 19,1 bzw. 13,7 Sek. / 125 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 27 kWh brutto / 225-228 km Ladeleistung: einphasig mit Wechselstrom (AC), optional bis 30 kW Gleichstrom (DC9 Ladedauer: 8h28 mit AC (3,7 kW), 45 min mit DC (20-80%) Maße: 3,70 m Länge / 2,42 m Radstand / 1,51 m Höhe / 308-1.104 Liter Kofferraum Hyundai Inster (3,83 m, noch nicht bestellbar) Mit 3,83 Meter Länge ist der Hyundai Inster das zweitkleinste Elektro-SUV nach dem Dacia Spring. Vorgestellt wurde das Auto im Juni 2024; damals hieß es, ein Preis von rund 25.000 Euro werde angestrebt. Ein genaues Marktstartdatum gibt es noch nicht. Für den Antrieb sorgen wahlweise ein 71- oder ein 85-kW-Motor. In die Basisversion wird ein 42-kWh-Akku für rund 300 km Reichweite eingebaut, die gehobene Variante soll rund 355 km schaffen. Basispreis: ca. 25.000 Euro (noch nicht bestellbar) Frontantrieb mit 71 bzw. 85 kW 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 11,7 bzw. 10,6 Sek. / 140 bzw. 150 km/h Akku/Reichweite: 42 bzw. 49 kWh / ca. 300 bzw. 355 km DC-Ladedauer: 30 min (beide Akkus, 10-80%) Maße: 3,83 m Länge / 2,58 m Radstand / 1,58 m Höhe / 351-1.059 Liter Kofferraum Fiat Grande Panda Elektro (3,99 m, noch nicht bestellbar) Der Fiat Grande Panda Elektro basiert wie der Citroen e-C3 auf der der Smart Car Platform, die besonders günstige Modelle ermöglicht. Mit 3,99 Meter ist der Wagen rund 18 cm kürzer als der Fiat 600 Elektro. Für den Antrieb sorgt ein 83 kW-Motor vorne, der sich den Strom aus einer LFP-Batterie mit 44 kWh holt. Die Preise sollen bei rund 25.000 Euro beginnen. Basispreis: ca. 25.000 Euro (noch nicht bestellbar) Frontantrieb mit 83 kW Akku/WLTP-Reichweite: 44 kWh (LFP) / ca. 320 km Max. Ladeleistung: vermutlich 3,7 kW einphasig mit AC, 100 kW mit DC DC-Ladedauer: vermutlich 26 min (20-80%) Maße: 3,99 m Länge / 2,54 m Radstand / 1,57 m Höhe / 361 Liter Kofferraum, Maximalvolumen nicht bekannt Citroen e-C3 (4,01 m) Im Oktober 2023 wurde ein veritabler Knaller vorgestellt: der Citroen e-C3. Seit Februar 2024 ist das Auto bestellbar. Das Besondere: Das 4,01 Meter lange Kleinwagen-SUV kostet nur 23.300 Euro. Dafür bekommt man einen 83-kW-Frontantrieb und eine 44-kWh-Batterie mit Lithium-Eisenphosphat-Chemie (LFP) für immerhin 300 km Reichweite. Aufgeladen wird mit bis zu 100 kW Gleichstrom, einen 11-kW-Bordlader gibt es nur optional. Auch einen Touchscreen gibt es nur bei der gehobenen Version. Technische Basis ist eine neue Billig-Plattform namens Smart Car Family. Basispreis: 23.300 Euro Frontantrieb mit 83 kW 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 11,0 Sek. / 132 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 44 kWh / 321-326 km Ladeleistung: einphasig (optional 11 kW) mit AC, serienmäßig 100 kW mit DC Ladedauer: 2h50 mit 11 kW AC (20-80%), 26 min mit DC (20-80%) Maße: 4,01 m Länge / 2,54 m Radstand / 1,57 m Höhe / 310 Liter Kofferraum, Maximalvolumen noch nicht bekannt Jeep Avenger (4,08 m) Der Jeep Avenger ist das erste Elektroauto der Marke; er ist seit Anfang 2023 bestellbar. Der Hersteller bezeichnet das Modell als SUV, doch die Höhe von 1,53 m ist geringer als beim VW ID.3, man kann sich also streiten. Der nur 4,08 Meter lange Wagen basiert jedenfalls auf der altbekannten Plattform eCMP; anders als ältere Modelle gibt es hier nur den neueren Elektroantrieb mit 115 kW und eine 54-kWh-Batterie. Damit ergeben sich rund 400 km Reichweite. Die Preise beginnen (nach einer Preiserhöhung im März) bei 38.500 Euro. Basispreis: 38.500 Euro Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,0 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 390-400 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 5h34 mit AC, 24 min mit DC (20-80%) Maße: 4,08 m Länge / 1,78 m Breite / 1,53 m Höhe / 355-1.252 Liter Kofferraum DS 3 E-Tense (4,12 m) Im April 2023 verlor der DS 3 Crossback E-Tense die Bezeichnung ""Crossback"" und heißt nun nur noch DS3 E-Tense. Außerdem erhielt er den neuen Elektromotor mit 115 statt 100 kW und eine größere Batterie mit 54 statt 50 kWh. So stieg die Maximalreichweite von 340 auf 404 Kilometer. Zunächst begannen die Preise bei arg unrealistischen 45.540 Euro, inzwischen ist die Basisversion für 41.500 Euro zu haben – immer noch ziemlich happig, aber das dürfte auch an der umfangreichen Ausstattung liegen. Basispreis: 41.2070 Euro (Ausstattung Pallas) Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,1 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh / 395-404 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 5h30 mit AC, 35 min mit DC (0-80%) Maße: 4,12 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,53 m Höhe / 350-1.050 Liter Kofferraum Renault 4 E-Tech Electric (4,14 m, noch nicht bestellbar) Der elektrische Renault 4 basiert wie der R5 auf der Plattform AmpR Small, gehört jedoch mit 1,57 m Höhe jedoch zu den kleinen SUVs. Die Technik ist vom Schwestermodell bekannt, allerdings wird die kleinste Motorisierung mit 70 kW hier nicht angeboten. So hat man die Wahl zwischen 90 und 110 kW, wobei die bekannten Batterien mit 40 bzw. 52 kWh eingebaut werden. Die Reichweiten sind mit rund 300 bzw. 400 km ähnlich wie beim R5 E-Tech Electric. Basispreis: k.A. Frontantrieb mit 90 kW / 225 Nm oder 110 kW / 245 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: ca. 9-8,5 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 40 oder 52 kWh netto / ca. 300 bzw. 400 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 80 bzw. 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 30 min mit DC (15-80%) Maße: 4,14 m Länge / 2,62m Radstand / 1,57 m Höhe / 420 Liter Kofferraum, Maximalvolumen nicht bekannt Opel Mokka Electric (4,15 m) Den Opel Mokka Electric erhielt im Herbst 2024 ein Facelift; dabei entfiel die Version mit 100 kW und 50-kWh-Akku. Damit gibt es nur noch die stärkere Variante mit 115 kW und größerer Batterie, die für 403 km nach WLTP reichen soll. Außerdem wurde das Auto endlich billiger. Statt 40.800 Euro werden nur noch 36.740 Euro für die Basisversion verlangt. Basispreis: 36.740 Euro Frontantrieb mit 115 kW / 260 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,2 bzw. 9,0 Sek. / 150 km/h Akku / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 403 km Ladeleistung: bis 11 kW AC, bis 100 kW DC Ladedauer: 5h15 mit AC, mit DC 27 min (""bis zu 80%"") Maße: 4,15 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,53 m Höhe / 350-1.060 Liter Kofferraum Alfa Romeo Junior (4,17 m) Der Alfa Romeo Junior sollte ursprünglich Milano heißen, aber auf Druck der italienischen Regierung wurde er kurz vor Marktstart noch umbenannt. Der Wagen basiert auf der Stellantis-Plattform eCMP und ist wie der Fiat 600 Elektro 4,17 Meter lang. Beim Antrieb gibt es eine Überraschung: Außer mit dem 115-kW-Motor gibt es auch einen mit 207 kW, der in die Version Veloce eingebaut wird. Die Preise beginnen bei 39.500 Euro, den Veloce gibt es für sehr ambitionierte 48.500 Euro. Basispreis: 39.500 Euro Frontantrieb mit 115 bzw. 207 kW / 260 bzw. 345 Nm 0-100 km/h / Höchstgeschwindigkeit: 9,0 bzw. 5,9 Sek. / 150 bzw. 200 km/h Akku: / WLTP-Reichweite: 54 kWh brutto, 51 kWh netto / 398-410 km (115 kW) Max. Ladeleistung: 11 kW mit AC, 100 kW mit DC DC-Ladedauer: < 30 min (10-80%) Maße: 4,17 m Länge / 2,56 m Radstand / 1,53 m Höhe / 400-1.265 Liter Kofferraum Fiat 600 Elektro (4,17 m) Der Fiat 600 Elektro sieht aus wie eine aufgepumpte Version des Fiat 500 mit Elektroantrieb, doch die Technik stammt nicht vom kleinen Bruder, sondern von der Stellantis-Konzernplattform eCMP. So ist das 4,17 Meter lange Auto ein Schwestermodell des Alfa Junior, Opel Mokka Electric und Jeep Avenger. Für den Antrieb sorgt der 115-kW-Motor, der Strom kommt aus der 54-kWh-Batterie. Damit sollen rund 400 km drin sein. Das Auto ist seit Juli 2023 konfigurierbar; angeboten werden die Version Red für 36.490 Euro und die Launch-Edition La Prima für 42.990 Euro.

Das Elektro-Einstiegsmodell hat Maße wie der VW ID.3, doch Volvo bezeichnet das Auto als SUV – wegen der hohen Sitzposition und großen Bodenfreiheit. Wie der Smart #1 und #3 basiert der EX30 auf der Plattform SEA von Konzernmutter Geely; wie dort gibt es einen 200-kW-Heckantrieb und einen Allradler mit 315 kW. Die Basisversion mit LFP-Akku schafft 337 km, die Long-Range-Variante mit NMC-Batterie bis zu 476 km. Der 315 kW starke Allradler bekommt stets den großen Akku und schafft 450 km.

So hat der Wagen sowohl den Kia Niro EV als auch den e-Soul verdrängt. Bestellen kann man das Auto seit August 2024, ausgeliefert wird ab Ende 2024. Der serienmäßige 150-kW-Frontantrieb wird wahlweise mit einer 55-kWh-Batterie für rund 440 km Reichweite oder mit einem 78-kWh-Akku für erstaunliche 600 km angeboten.

As a participant in multiple affiliate marketing programs, National Geographic will earn a commission for certain purchases. See full disclaimer below.* When I was younger, my bicycle was not only my main source of enjoyment, but also my primary mode of transportation. On weekends and summer vacations, I’d hop on my Huffy each morning, not knowing what adventure lay before me. As an adult, I get many of those same feelings when I throw my leg over an e-bike. Electric vehicles may grab all the headlines, but electric bicycles are much cheaper and even better for the environment. As a longtime cyclist, I’ve spent years testing e-bikes from dozens of manufacturers, including the ones on this list. The best electric bikes—including our top pick, the Gazelle Eclipse T11—can’t be beat when it comes to versatility, utility, and, of course, sheer fun. But not all e-bikes are created equal. Some are better suited for singletrack (narrow dirt trails for mountain bikes), while others are designed to replace your second car. Older riders wanting a weekend joy ride may choose a different e-bike than a person looking to commute to work. Here are the best electric bikes to suit a variety of needs. The best electric bikes of 2024 The best electric bikes are versatile, but each has strengths that make them stand out from the crowd. Here are the details on our top picks. Best electric bike overall: Gazelle Eclipse T11 Photograph courtesy Gazelle Buy it now at Mike’s Bikes Why we like it: I’ve ridden dozens of electric bikes over the years, but very few have impressed me from the first pedal stroke like the Eclipse T11 . The Bosch motor was quick to engage and incredibly smooth at every assist level. The display and interface were the best of any bike I tested, detailing nearly everything I needed to know about my ride. In addition to speed and distance, I could toggle to other screens for the watts I was producing or how many miles I could ride at each assist level. The adjustable front fork—the part that connects the front wheel to the frame—soaked up all the roughness on the road. The Shimano MT420 hydraulic disc brakes provided ample stopping power. The huge battery means you can ride up to 100 miles on a single charge. In short, this e-bike has almost everything you could want in one fast-moving package. It even comes with a bell. Keep in mind: The frame is a little bulky and the handlebar is narrower than most bikes I’ve ridden in the past. It would be great to be able to organize data so riders can see the most important details on one screen. Product details: Weight: 59 lbs. | Motor/Battery: 750W | Range: 100 miles in Eco mode | Assist levels: 4 | Top speed: 28 mph Best electric commuter bike: Priority Current Photograph courtesy Priority Bicycles Buy it now at Priority Bicycles Why we like it: I’ve ridden the Priority Current with the 500wh Enviolo motor more than any other e-bike and across all sorts of terrain. It’s handled everything I’ve thrown at it, but it shines as a daily commuter bike. One of its best-selling points is the Gates carbon belt drive. It requires much less maintenance than a standard chain and cogs, so riders no longer need to clean and lube a chain or risk getting an oily stain on their pant leg while riding. This is great for folks who don’t have the experience or desire to wrench on their bikes. The Current ships as a Class 1 e-bike with a top speed of 20 mph, but a quick adjustment on the display menu boosts that to 28 mph. At the highest e-assist level, riders can reach top speed in just a few pedal strokes. With the addition of the optional battery extender rack , you can double your estimated range up to 100 miles. Keep in mind: Shifting on the Enviolo model feels different than on a regular geared bike, but riders should get the hang of it fairly quickly. The Current ships with a small tube of touch-up paint, which is needed, because the bike chips easily. Priority currently doesn’t sell the Current and battery extender as a complete e-bike, which means you have to do some work on it yourself or take it to a shop. Product details: Weight: 53 lbs. | Motor/Battery: 500W | Range: 50 miles standard, up to 100 miles with the optional auxiliary battery and rack | Assist levels: 5 | Top speed: 28 mph (Here’s everything you need to start road cycling.) Best electric bike for cargo: Xtracycle RFA Buy it now at Xtracycle Why we like it: For many urban households, the RFA can function like a second car. I can easily ride it to the local grocery store, load up nearly a week’s worth of groceries in the saddlebags, and pedal home with zero issues. With the smaller 24-inch wheels, the center of gravity is low enough that you don’t need to worry about toppling over. The 630wh motor lets you haul any number of items (under the 470-pound limit), including an adult passenger (or up to three kids) with the Hooptie passenger system (sold separately). Unlike other models, the RFA’s step-through steel frame comes in one size, but a quick seat post adjustment allows multiple family members to share. Xtracycle offers multiple accessories like child seats and front racks to make the RFA even more versatile. When you’re not using it as a grocery getter or child hauler, it’s really fun to ride. Keep in mind: Compared to a typical bicycle, the frame extends farther back, so the weight distribution may seem a bit off at first. Because this e-bike is longer, it’ll take up a bit more storage space. The look of the bike takes some getting used to, but its utilitarian nature allows you to get over that quickly. Product details: Weight: 60 lbs. | Motor/Battery: 630W | Range: Up to 60 miles in the low mode | Assist levels: 3 | Top speed: 20-28 mph, depending on the model Best electric mountain bike: Aventon Ramblas Buy it now at Aventon Why we like it: Many electric bikes feel like you’re piloting a tank, but the Ramblas rides exactly like a hardtail mountain bike should (albeit a somewhat heavy one). On the singletrack, it rips and flows, while the 750wh motor allows you to conquer some pretty steep inclines. The 80-mile range in Eco mode means you can still have epic days in the saddle without worrying that your battery will run out of juice. While some manufacturers skimp on the bike components, Aventon based the Ramblas with the components you’d expect to find on a standard low-to-mid range mountain bike. The 130mm-travel RockShox 35 Silver fork has plenty of cushioning when riding over obstacles. The 12-speed SRAM Eagle groupset shifted perfectly and gave me plenty of gear options for both the flats and the hills. The Maxxis Rekon tires grip the dirt. Keep in mind: Because the damper can’t be adjusted, the front fork gets bouncy when you accelerate. The dropper seat can be a bit finicky when you try to adjust it. One key note: Mountain biking requires skill to be safe. Electric mountain bikes can quickly allow riders—especially inexperienced ones—to get in over their heads. I highly recommend novices learn to ride singletrack properly on a standard bike rather than jump into an electric model. Product details: Weight: 54 lbs. | Motor/Battery: 750W | Range: 80 miles in Eco mode | Assist levels: 3 | Top speed: 20 mph (Try bike camping—the easy way) Best foldable electric bike: Ride1Up Portola Buy it now at Ride1Up Why we like it: Ideal for riders with limited storage space, the Portola offers versatility in a portable package. It folds neatly to fit in a closet, cubicle, or car trunk, but still offers performance equal to that of larger electric bikes. It’s got some pep for such a small bike; pedaling in high mode feels like being fired out of a rocket. The bike arrives as a Class 2 e-bike, with a throttle and high speed of 20 mph, but you can easily disable the throttle or increase the top speed to 28 mph. The 20-inch tires are three inches wide, giving users a very stable riding platform. Combined with the three levels of pedal-assist, the eight-speed Shimano groupset will allow riders to tackle most terrain. This is a great option for RVers who don’t want to deal with mounting a bike rack on the back of their vehicles. Keep in mind: Because it’s a folding bike, the geometry is a bit different and can feel somewhat awkward during initial rides. There’s very little cockpit adjustability. This bike may fold into a relatively small size, but it’s still fairly hefty at nearly 60 pounds. Product details: Weight: 59 lbs. | Motor/Battery: 750W | Range: Up to 45 miles | Assist levels: 3 | Top speed: 28 mph Best electric bike for seniors: Schwinn Mendocino Step Thru Buy it now at Schwinn Why we like it: Practically everyone born before 1980 learned how to ride a bike on a Schwinn. The Schwinn Mendocino offers a dependable ride at a respectable value. Older riders will appreciate the 26-inch wheels keeping them lower to the ground than many electric bike models. The step-through frame makes getting on and off the bike much easier, while the upright riding position doesn’t aggravate problem backs as much. The throttle allows riders to get up to speed more quickly. The power monitor is simple, with no complicated display screens. (Full disclosure: While I didn’t ride the Mendocino for this test, I did ride a similar Schwinn model.) Keep in mind: This is a good bike for pedaling rail trails on the weekends, but not much more. Seniors may find it difficult to lift this 66-pound bike onto a car rack or haul it up stairs. Currently, there are two versions of this bike—a 500-watt version and another, less-powerful 250-watt version that was recently discontinued, but can still be found online for under $1,000. Product details: Weight: 66 lbs. | Motor/Battery: 500W | Range: Up to 45 miles | Assist levels: 3 | Top speed: 20 mph (This is why Minneapolis should be your next biking break) How we chose the best electric bike I’ve spent most of my life pedaling bicycles, riding and racing them throughout the American Midwest and around the world. Over the last several years, I’ve gravitated toward electric bikes, testing models from dozens of manufacturers, including each of the e-bikes featured here. Other than my expertise, I based my rankings on the following factors: • Third-party reviews: When I felt that my expertise was lacking, I referred to expert sources online, including product reviews. • Brand reputation: The internet is filled with e-bikes of various stripes, many of which aren’t the best quality. I chose trusted brands that offer a generous warranty. • Feedback from other riders: During the evaluation process, a few trusted riders of varying experience levels graciously offered their personal feedback and criticisms. What is an electric bike? An electric bike is a bicycle with an electric motor that allows riders to ride faster, farther, or more easily, based on the size of the motor. Tips for buying an electric bike There are many e-bike makers out there. Here are a few key points to consider when shopping for an electric bike. Know how you plan to use it If you’re planning short rides on local rail trails, then you don’t need an e-bike with a massive range. Want to replace your car? A cargo bike with lots of storage and room for kid seats may be the answer. Get to know your local bike shop Your local bike shop is a great resource for purchasing and maintaining an e-bike. They can give you personalized recommendations, assemble the bike for you, and do any repairs or maintenance you’re not comfortable doing yourself. Budget for accessories Before you hand over your credit card, you’ll need some additional items. A helmet is a must. A bike-specific multi-tool, spare tube, and inflator, plus a seat bag to store these are also important. Don’t forget a water bottle and cage. Buy from an established brand Unfortunately, some e-bikes are manufactured and sold by fly-by-night companies using sub-standard materials. There have been documented reports from fire departments across the country about fires started by charging e-bike batteries. It’s best to buy from manufacturers who sell electric bikes that come with certification from a reputable testing company and a generous warranty. Frequently asked questions What is the average lifespan of an electric bike? With routine maintenance, an e-bike can last 10 years or more. A heavily used e-bike might have a lifespan approximately half that. Do electric bikes charge when you pedal? No. Electric bikes charge when they are plugged into an outlet. What are the disadvantages of electric bikes? E-bikes are heavier than standard bikes, which can be a literal pain when carrying them up steps or mounting them on a bike rack. They also have a limited range. For example, if your e-bike has an effective range of 30 miles and you’ve reached your turnaround point at 20 miles, you may have to ride the last 10 miles without pedal assist.

Cheapest electric cars 2024: affordable EVs,"Price is one of the main factors preventing motorists from trading in their petrol or diesel car for an electric one, so we’ve put together a list of the cheapest electric cars on sale in 2024.",https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/electric/cheapest-electric-car/,,2024-11-12 00:00:00,CAR Magazine,,"► Our list of the cheapest electric cars on sale ► Options range from dinky quadricycles to SUVs ► Prices start from just £7695 Price is one of the main factors preventing motorists from trading in their petrol or diesel car for an electric one, so we’ve put together a list of the cheapest electric cars on sale in 2024. The fact is, the best electric cars cost significantly more than their conventionally powered peers because the materials in their battery packs and electric motors are expensive – and few manufacturers are prepared to make a loss on each EV they sell. But there are signs this is changing, and 2024 is proving turning point with the introduction of more affordable EVs including the £15,000 Dacia Spring and Citroen’s low-price e-C3 retailing at a whisker under £22k. Recent months have seen several car makers cut the price of their EVs in a bid to make them more attractive, with manufacturers under greater pressure to meet electric car sales targets that came into force in 2024. The cheapest electric cars on this list might not have the fancy interior technology and safety equipment you’ll find in something like a Tesla Model 3, and they might not have the glamour of the best electric luxury cars, but you can’t argue with the value. The best cheap electric cars at a glance: Below, we’ve rounded up the cheapest electric cars on sale in the UK today. Our list includes tiny electric quadricycles, family-sized electric hatchbacks and compact electric SUVs. This list has changed in recent months due to the introduction of new models and a price cut to existing EVs. We’ve also included links to our dedicated review for each electric car if you need some extra information on how they drive. Scroll down for some inspiration. The cheapest electric vehicles (EVs) to buy in 2024 Citroen Ami – from £7695 Best for: City-only driving Pros: Minuscule dimensions, great fun, no car will get more attention Cons: Bad ride, you’ve seen the video of one being rolled in Monaco, right? Citroen had one goal in mind when it was designing the Ami – to build the ultimate small electric car. And it bashed the nail on the head with a 20lb sledgehammer. The Ami is perfectly suited to city life. It’s small, so it can fit down narrow alleys. Its cabin is surrounded by glass, so you can spot kamikaze moped riders long before you could in a conventional car. Plus, because it’s electric, you don’t need to pay Sadiq Khan a single penny to drive into the centre of London, at least for now. The only fault with the Ami is that it only works in the city. It has a maximum range of 46 miles and a top speed of just 28mph. That’s more than enough for zipping around Knightsbridge but nowhere enough to venture out of the city and onto an A-road. It’s achingly slow. Stay within the confines of town, and you’ll be king of all you survey, though. The Ami is more than nimble enough to carve up Civics and Golfs on roundabouts, while its 8bhp motor is sprightly enough to surprise them at the lights.

But that changes later in 2024 when a new version of the Spring lands in the UK. A compact city that’s quite a lot smaller than the Sandero, the Spring grabs the headlines with a starting price of just £14,995, making it by far the cheapest proper electric car available. Finance deals have been confirmed from £169 a month with a £2325 deposit on a four-year PCP lease deal, with interest at 3.9% APR. The new Spring is powered by a fairly small 44bhp motor as standard, with a dizzying 64bhp available from higher-spec versions. A 26.8kWh battery allows for a claimed range of up to 140 miles, giving scope for some out-of-town trips but you wouldn’t want to go too far as it’s not very quick to charge with a maximum 30kW DC rapid charging rate. Standard kit includes a digital instrument cluster, cruise control and rear parking sensors as well. The Spring is available to pre-order now and the first right-hand drive UK cars are expected by October. To find out more read our full Dacia Spring review Leapmotor T03 – from £15,995 Best for: Urban commuters seeking a budget-friendly electric option Leapmotor is only just now on the cusp of reaching European shores thanks to distribution networks from Stellantis. It’s been developed almost entirely in-house – even the battery is homegrown, aside from a few of the cells – but some of the styling quirks seem familiar. Specs-wise, the T03’s 37.3 kWh battery provides a WLTP-rated range of 165 miles. A modest 93bhp motor yielding a 0-62 mph time of 12.7 seconds, but that’s enough for city driving and outperforms similar budget EVs like the Dacia Spring. The build quality feels solid for a car in this price range, and features include five doors and a spacious cabin with decent headroom. Buyers should note its limited 165-mile range and shorter-than-average warranty, though. Read our full review of the Leapmotor T03 here. Citroen e-C3 – from £21,990 Best for: Cheap and the promise of comfort Pros: Good range, great price, very comfortable Cons: Slow steering, boot is an awkward shape Citroen already has a fairly expansive line-up of electric models, but it’s hunting the cheaper end of the market with its new e-C3, which arrives as part of a fourth generation of Citroen’s popular supermini. Getting a chunkier look to appeal to SUV-loving buyers, the e-C3 comes with the firm’s trademark comfy suspension and seats, and it’ll likely prove a great daily driver. Orders are yet to open but it’s expected to arrive in the UK before the close of 2024, and makes for a great option with its 199-mile range and quick 100kW DC charging. It drives well, is surprisingly spacious and comes with plenty of kit as standard, with an attractive £21,990 starting price considering it’s a much more rounded car than the Spring. Find out more and read the Citroen e-C3 review BYD Dolphin – from £26,140 Best for: Those wanting something different Pros: Fantastic value for money, interesting interior, comfortable ride Cons: MG4 is better to drive for similar money, intrusive safety tech Chinese brand BYD gives you a lot of car for the money with its amusingly named Dolphin, which is far larger than the other cars on this so far. It has enough space inside for four adults, plus it has a 345-litre boot. The cheapest £26,140 model features a 45kWh battery allowing a claimed maximum range of 211 miles, but a larger 60kWh unit increases this to 265 miles. It even drives quite well. Sure, it isn’t as polished as a European electric hatchback, such as a Cupra Born, but it still offers plenty of grip and manageable levels of body roll. And, if you opt for the more expensive 60kWh 201bhp version, you’ll have a car that can dash from 0–62mph in 6.7 seconds. The interior is quirky, too – the infotainment screen is mounted on a motor and can spin through 90 degrees to be either portrait or landscape.

That said, the EV model has always been scuppered by its expensive price. But Vauxhall has addressed the Corsa’s high price with the addition of a new value-packed ‘Yes Edition’, that drops the Corsa EV’s starting price by a significant £5,550. You still get the same 134bhp electric motor and 50kWh battery enabling a claimed 221 miles from a charge too. And it’s not like Vauxhall has ripped out all the equipment either, as you still get LED headlights, keyless entry and a 10-inch touchscreen to name just a few highlights. To find out more read our full Vauxhall Corsa Electric review Vauxhall Corsa Electric Lease Deals VIEW OFFER MG 4 EV – from £26,995 Best for: Everything, really Pros: Great to drive, long range, plenty of tech Cons: Interior feels a bit cheap, iffy reliability Like the Dolphin, the MG 4 EV is another Chinese electric hatchback. But, where the BYD focuses on comfort, the MG majors on driver engagement. It’s arguably the best-driving car in its class, running rings around the likes of the Volkswagen ID.3 while simultaneously shaving thousands off its asking price. When you’re pushing really hard, the MG 4’s rear-driven platform will even allow you to slide the back end out, just like a sports car. It’s a riot. Happily, the MG 4 is more than just a one-trick pony. It’s practical, too. There’s enough space in the back for two adults, and it has a reasonably sized 363-litre boot. Granted, the ID. 3’s rear seats are more comfortable for adults, and its boot is slightly larger at 385 litres, but you should expect to make a few sacrifices when the price gulf between the two cars is more than £8,000. The beauty of the MG 4 is that you make fewer sacrifices than you’d expect.

That’s because it has a tiny 35.5kWh battery pack, whereas most of its rivals have batteries of 50kWh or more. The result? A maximum WLTP range of 124 miles and a best-case real-world range of only 100 miles. Ouch. Still, you should at least have fun on your distance-restricted outings because, like most Mazdas, the MX-30 is fun to drive. It is also loaded with interesting design features, such as reverse-opening rear doors, wooden trim on the centre console and soft door card trims made from recycled plastic bottles. While previously quite tough to recommend, Mazda has recently slashed prices by £3,000, making it seem a whole lot more appealing at £27,995. Read our Mazda MX-30 review Mazda MX-30 Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Fiat 500 Electric – from £28,195 Best for: The fashion-conscious Pros: Looks great, drives well, recent price cut Cons: Range isn’t amazing with standard trim, isn’t particularly practical We like the Fiat 500 Electric. It’s by no means the fastest, most practical or longest-legged electric hatchback on sale – but it does have the biggest character. Just like its petrol-powered predecessor, it’s ideally suited to the city. However, it’s sophisticated enough to allow you to tackle faster roads. Providing you keep a mental note of all the nearby charging stations, that is. The entry-level model only has a tiny 24kWh battery that offers a maximum official range of 118 miles. The 500e has always been quite expensive by city car standards, but Fiat has recently slashed its price to improve sales. It now starts from £21,995 for the entry-level 24kWh version, with a 118-mile range. We’d recommend paying the £24,995 for the larger 42kWh battery, which manages a claimed 199 miles between charges. It’s good to drive and gets lots of tech for such a small car car, but isn’t very practical so is best treated as a two-seater.

The most basic cars cost from £28,495 – and even the flagship Tekna variant (with its Bose audio system and clever driver assistance kit) will give you back a fiver’s change from £32,000. These days, you can only have the Leaf with a 39kWh battery, giving you a maximum range of 168 miles. Its electric motor serves up 148bhp, but the Leaf never encourages you to drive spiritedly. Its suspension is set up for comfort, and its steering is rather light and vague, which means it’s at its happiest bumbling along at 10mph under the speed limit. Nissan has recently stopped production of the Leaf as it gears up to launch its next generation of EVs, so vehicles are available from stock only. Nissan Leaf Lease Deals VIEW OFFER Peugeot e-208 – £28,600 Best for: Stylish all-rounder Pros: Stylish design, Easy to drive, lots of equipment Cons: Awkward driving position, not all that spacious The Peugeot e-208 has always been a credible small electric car, but with one caveat: its high price. The French firm seems to be acknowledging this now, with a recent price cut meaning this supermini now comes in at £28,600, and reduces the gap between EVs and petrol models. Though not everyone will get on with Peugeot’s trademark awkward driving position, the e-208 is otherwise very easy to drive and live with, gets a decent range of 224 miles (claimed) and is arguably the best-looking supermini you can buy too. Standard equipment also includes climate control, LED lights and a 10-inch touchscreen too. To find out more read our full Peugeot e-208 review View Peugeot e-208 Lease Deals VIEW OFFER What is the cheapest electric car to buy today? That depends on your definition of ‘car.’ The cheapest fully enclosed, road-legal, four-wheeled vehicle you can buy is the Citroen Ami, priced from just £7695. However, it isn’t legally recognised as a car – it’s a pure-electric quadricycle. The cheapest proper electric car you can buy is the Dacia Spring, which costs from just £14,995. Are electric cars getting cheaper? Gradually, with much of that change being driven by Chinese manufacturers. Falling R&D costs, economies of scale, and the presence of smaller, less upmarket electric cars to sit alongside the big electric SUVs and saloons that kickstarted the whole shift towards electrification mean the market’s becoming ever more friendly to those on a budget. With manufacturers increasingly under pressure to shift more EVs to meet mandatory sales targets, we’re seeing more firms cut the prices of their existing models to boost demand. Cupra, Honda, Mazda and Vauxhall have all slashed the prices of their electric cars in recent months. This will trend will only likely continue later in 2024. Is it worth buying a used electric car? Buying any used car always means you’ll take on a certain amount of risk, but EVs are a different kettle of fish. The positives? There are far fewer parts to go wrong, and most are loaded with technology. But the value of an EV hinges on the condition of its battery pack – and if the cells have been thrashed by the car’s previous owner, you could end up with a lemon that won’t do half of its claimed range. On newer EVs, you shouldn’t need to worry. There are some significant savings on nearly-new cars to be had if you’re not bothered about being the first person to have their name on the V5. We’ve compiled a guide to buying a used EV that includes a list of the best cars you might want to consider. Follow the link above to learn more. Are there any cheap EVs worth waiting for? In 2024 we’ll see the arrival of two far more affordable EVs mentioned in this article. The first is the new Dacia Spring, a car that’s been on sale in other European countries for several years, but will now come to the UK for the first time, with a starting price of just £14,995. Citroen’s e-C3 will be a larger and more substantial offering on top of that, and be available for less than £23,000, again undercutting the opposition. Are electric cars cheap to charge? That depends on where you charge your electric car. Plug in at a motorway rapid charger at peak times, and you could end up spending more on electricity than you would for a tank of fuel in an equivalent petrol car. However, you could save hundreds of pounds if you charge up at home using a wallbox charger and an intelligent charge scheduler that can reap the benefits of an off-peak electricity tariff.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a comprehensive list of affordable electric vehicles in 2024 and touches on the evolving price trends in the EV industry.

However, a handful of vehicles consistently outshine the rest, securing their positions as the top-selling cars in India. The competition in the Indian automobile industry is fierce, and in 2023, India ranked as the fourth biggest in the world in terms of overall automobile production. As of 2023, India is the 3rd largest automobile market in the world regarding sales. To keep up with climate change, the Indian Government is actively promoting green mobility initiatives. In such a competitive automobile market, which cars are good enough to retain spots as the highest-selling cars in India? Let’s explore the list and see why they are at the top. We have compiled a list of India's highest-selling cars in October 2024 below, with data taken from industry sources. Let’s look at the features that make these the highest-selling cars in India. Maruti Suzuki Ertiga Price range: Rs8.64 - Rs13.08 lakh Mileage: 20.3 kmpl to 26.11 km/kg Type: Multi-purpose Vehicle (MPV) The Maruti Ertiga stands as the top-selling MUV in India, earning a dependable reputation over the years. Offering spacious accommodation for seven occupants, a reliable framework, and an efficient powertrain, the Ertiga caters to the needs of most MUV seekers in India. Additionally, its CNG variants attract significant attention from cab companies. Under the hood, the Ertiga features a 1.5-litre petrol engine equipped with mild hybrid technology. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual gearbox and a 6-speed automatic transmission. Regarding fuel efficiency, the Ertiga achieves 20.51 km/l on petrol and 26.11 km/kg on CNG. Maruti Suzuki Swift Price range: Rs5.99- Rs9.03 lakh Mileage: 22.38 kmpl to 30.9 km/kg Type: Hatchback For many in India, mentioning the word 'car' brings to mind the Maruti Swift. Since its introduction in 2005, this Indo-Japanese hatchback has maintained an unparalleled dominance, consistently securing a place among the top-selling cars in India. The Maruti Swift continues to be celebrated for its expansive interior space and exceptional mileage of 22.38 km/l with petrol and 30.90 km/kg with CNG.

Hyundai Creta Price range: Rs10.87- Rs19.20 lakh Mileage: 17 kmpl to 23 kmpl Type: Crossover SUV The Hyundai Creta secured the tenth position on the list of top-selling cars in India. Creta reaffirms its status as the best-selling mid-size SUV and the sole Hyundai entry in this list. The Hyundai Creta is gradually descending on the list due to the increasing popularity of its competitors, like the Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder. Nevertheless, the Korean SUV deserves recognition for maintaining its position as the leading mid-size SUV in terms of sales. Maruti Suzuki Brezza Price range: Rs8.29- Rs14.14 lakh Mileage: 17.38 kmpl to 25.51 km/kg Type: Crossover SUV Following the Tata Nexon, the Maruti Brezza is a significant contender in the compact SUV segment. The latest generation, introduced last year, has proven to be a formidable competitor among its peers, leveraging Maruti's established trust and giving Brezza an advantage over its rivals. The Brezza has a 1.5-litre petrol engine paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed torque converter automatic. Additionally, the Brezza comes with mild-hybrid technology in all automatic variants, providing a mileage of 17.38 – 19.8 km/l. Like most Maruti vehicles, the Brezza also offers CNG variants that deliver a mileage of 25.51 km/kg.

It has design elements of Grand Vitara and Baleno in both the interior and exterior. Its interior is equipped with a 9-inch touchscreen, wireless charger, 360 camera, and 2 and 6 airbags, depending upon the variant. Under its hood, Maruti Fronx boosts the power of the one turbo Boosterjet engine with a power of 100 hp. Its design and performance put it in competition with other SUV compact models such as the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, and Tata Nexon. Maruti Suzuki Baleno Price range: Rs6.61 - Rs9.88 lakh Mileage: 22.35 kmpl to 30.61 km/kg. Type: Hatchback Maruti Baleno is renowned for its spacious interior and efficient powertrain and consistently retains its position in India's list of best-selling cars. The Baleno RS provides maximum torque over a wide RPM range (150 Nm @ 1700-4500 RPM). This feature allows the driver to cruise without frequent gear changes. Like the Maruti Swift, the Maruti Baleno is equipped with the same 1.2-liter dualjet petrol engine with any 5-speed manual or 5-speed AMT, which is also available in CNG-driven versions. The Baleno provides a mileage of 22.94 km/l with petrol and 30.61 km/kg with CNG. Tata Punch Price range: Rs6- Rs10.10 lakh Mileage: 18.8 kmpl to 26.99 km/kg Type: SUV Since its debut, this Indian compact SUV has sustained remarkable success. Despite being the smallest in its category, the Tata Punch boasts interiors resembling a full-size SUV. Additionally, it holds a 5-star G-NCAP safety rating, placing it among the safest cars in India. Most notably, these attributes come at an attractive price range: Rs 6 to 10.10 lakh. Recently, Tata expanded the Punch lineup to include CNG variants, widening its appeal to a more diverse range of buyers. Mahindra Scorpio N + Classic Price range: Rs15.62- Rs20.03 lakh Mileage: 16.36 kmpl-15.4 kmpl Type: SUV The Mahindra Scorpio has long held a strong position in the SUV segment, and its recent inclusion in the top-selling cars in India is primarily because of the increasing demand for robust SUVs, further propelled by the festive season. Currently, the Scorpio lineup comprises two models: the ever-popular Scorpio Classic, a perennial favourite among SUV buyers, and the newer Scorpio N, launched last year, which has been a remarkable success from its inception. Tata Nexon Price range: Rs8.10- Rs15.50 lakh Mileage: 17.18 kmpl to 24.08 kmpl Type: Crossover SUV The outstanding performance of the Tata Nexon has been instrumental in making Tata the third-largest carmaker in India. The Tata Nexon dominates the compact SUV segment. Consistently ranking among the best-selling cars in India, the recent facelift has contributed to its continued success. The new Tata Nexon retains the same engine choices, featuring a 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine and a 1.5-litre turbo diesel engine. In addition to the earlier transmission options, the 6-speed manual gearbox and 6-speed AMT, the Nexon now offers a 7-speed DCT automatic for the petrol variants. Moreover, the electric versions of Nexon rank as the best-selling EVs in India, boosting the Nexon's overall sales performance. Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara Price range: Rs10.87 Lakh and Rs17.13 Lakh Mileage: 19.38 to 27.97 kmpl Type: Crossover SUV Grand Vitara is the sixth car to feature on the list from the stable of Maruti Suzuki.

Grand Vitara comes with its standard petrol engine, but also offers self-charging strong-hybrid petrol engine. The car competes with MG Astor, Honda Elevate, Kia Seltos, VW Taigun, Skoda Kushaq, and Citroen Basalt in this category.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides an overview of the top-selling cars in India as of October 2024.

Meet e-Vitara: Suzuki’s first battery-electric car,CAR magazine UK reveals the first details of the new Suzuki e-Vitara - the brand's first battery-electric production car,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/suzuki/evitara/,,2024-11-11 17:29:00,CAR Magazine,,"► Suzuki e-Vitara SUV revealed ► It’s the brand’s first electric production car ► Design is based off eVX concept Suzuki has revealed its first-ever battery-electric production car: the new e-Vitara. Feels a bit weird for this to be the brand’s first, given how far along so many other brands are with their electrification strategies. But Suzuki will not be rushed, instead relying on partnerships with Toyota to offer full and plug-in hybrid models as it develops its own technology. The design of the new e-Vitara is based off the eVX concept – a small, chunky EV show car that first made its debut at the 2023 Tokyo Auto Salon. It’s chunky and bulky in all the usual SUV ways, with plenty of cladding and an aggressive frown on its face. Inside, the new e-Vitara has a pair of screens for driver’s instruments and infotainment, and a reasonably tidy interior layout that includes physical switchgear. The more interesting bits are under the skin, though. Suzuki has used a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack here – known for being cheaper and less reliant on rare earths than a more conventional lithium-manganese-cobalt mix – and it runs on a battery-electric version of its ‘HEARTECT’ platform that underpins countless other models. For Europe, the e-Vitara comes in a few powertrain flavours. The entry level model features a 49kWh battery pack and a single e-motor on the front axle developing 142bhp. There are also two power variants for the larger 61kWh battery pack: a 172bhp front-driven model or a 236bhp all-wheel drive model. All e-Vitara models feature an ‘e-axle’ that incorporates the electric motor and inverter, with the all-wheel drive model also featuring a Trail drive mode for extra grip off-road. Range and performance figures haven’t been announced yet. ‘We will provide a variety of options, including BEVs, hybrid vehicles and CNG behicles tailored to specific regions,’ says Toshihiro Suzuki, company president. ‘Following the launch of the e-Vitara, we will continue to expand our BEV line-up.’ The new e-Vitara will go on sale in the summer of 2025.",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article offers a fresh perspective on Suzuki's entry into the electric vehicle market with its first battery-electric production car, the e-Vitara.

New small but mighty electric vehicles to push boundaries for last-mile logistics,"ELM Mobility, a new joint venture from two UK pioneers, is pushing ahead with plans to launch a groundbreaking new last-mile EV from 2028. Rally and vehi",https://fleetworld.co.uk/new-small-but-mighty-electric-vehicles-to-push-boundaries-for-last-mile-logistics/,,2024-11-11 14:30:00,Fleet World,,"ELM Mobility, a new joint venture from two UK pioneers, is pushing ahead with plans to launch a groundbreaking new last-mile EV from 2028. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Rally and vehicle technology specialist Prodrive has teamed up with design agency Astheimer in a move to create the first ground-up, fit-for-purpose last-mile delivery platform, which they say will transform safety, versatility and efficiency for fleets around the ground. A demonstrator has already debuted at Cenex Expo 2024 and the next step will see the project go into production readiness ahead of certification. Pre-series production vehicles will be trialled by customers, with start of UK production planned for 2028. Prices are expected to start from around £25,000. According to both firms, current last-mile EVs fall short in terms of reliability, safety, driver comfort and payload volume, or are simply too large and costly for the task in hand. Their zero-emission Evolv quadricycle demonstrator showcased at Cenex Expo tackles this, with a cubic load capacity rivalling mid-size vans. Unveiled just 12 months after the project received a share of a £22.7m investment from the UK government’s Department for Business and Trade (DBT), via the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC), the Evolv demonstrator is a small L7e category quadricycle that the firms say offers the same load capacity and passive safety crash standards as N1 small vans. Its compact footprint measures just 3,240mm long, 1,450mm wide, 2,150mm high and weighs 850kg with batteries, but it’s able to pack in 4m3 using two load spaces, putting it on a par with some mid-size vans. The main load area can accommodate a 1.6m tall Euro pallet with a 300kg payload. It’s accessed on the side via secure self-locking sliding doors and has a 300mm load bed height. The secondary load area, accessible through rear ‘barn doors’, provides additional space for a 1.2m tall Euro pallet and 200kg payload. Able to be driven with a standard car licence, the demonstrator is equipped with a 20kWh battery to enable a 100-mile (62km) range with a top speed of 50mph (80km/h) but other battery capacities are under consideration for the production models, and will be explored in the next phase of development. These are expected to have a 20-80% AC charge time of less than two hours. The interior has been designed around the driver ergonomics. The central driver seat offers easier access from either side and provides better visibility of pedestrians and cyclists through the wraparound windscreen; it also streamlines the number of variants for the UK and European markets. The flexible platform will allow for a family of models, adaptable to the needs of each customer. The demonstrator has a tight 7.8m turning circle and is also designed for high uptime and low maintenance. Following its unveiling at Cenex Expo, the electric quadricycle is now being used to advance discussions with stakeholders and potential customers in logistics, retailing and food deliveries. Dr Iain Roche, CEO of Prodrive Advanced Technology, said: “Evolv demonstrates how our collective innovative design and engineering can push the boundaries of what a last mile EV can achieve. With Evolv, a compact footprint can go hand-in-hand with serious capability and efficiency. Evolv offers the best of both worlds, injecting versatility without compromise into a logistics fleet.” For more of the latest industry news, click here.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a considerable amount of original insights and analysis regarding the development of a new last-mile electric vehicle by ELM Mobility, a joint venture by Rally and Prodrive, and design agency Astheimer.

Best used electric cars 2024: Top 10 second-hand EVs to buy,The Independent's Electric Vehicles Channel is sponsored by E.ON Next. Now is the perfect time to buy a secondhand EV – and with sales of used electric cars growing faster than new EV sales ...,https://www.independent.co.uk/cars/electric-vehicles/best-used-electric-cars-evs-uk-b2611282.html,,2024-11-11 00:14:00,The Independent,,"SPONSORED BY E.ON NEXT The Independent's Electric Vehicles Channel is sponsored by E.ON Next. Now is the perfect time to buy a secondhand EV – and with sales of used electric cars growing faster than new EV sales right now, it’s easy to see why. Electric cars tend to lose their value pretty quickly, in some cases falling by as much as 50 per cent in the first year alone, and while that’s an uncomfortable thought for new owners, it’s fantastic news if you fancy picking up a used-car bargain. Fears that electric car batteries won’t last long enough are quickly becoming a thing of the past now, too – as we proved when testing a decade-old Tesla Model S with more than 250,000 miles on the clock. Crucially, that car was still using its original battery, and had 84 per cent of its original capacity remaining. That – along with frequent software updates than fix bugs and even add new features years after they launched – is just one reason why the Model S and smaller Tesla Model 3 appear among our ten favourite used EVs to buy in the UK. A key point to remember when buying a used EV is, if it has been serviced correctly, the battery will likely still be covered by its eight-year manufacturer warranty. This means if the battery, of its ancillary components, fail during that time, the manufacturer will fix or replace the faulty parts without any costs coming back to you. The two Kias on our list get the remainder of their seven-year manufacturer cover for used car owners. You should also remember that, as with all used-car buys, condition and history are crucial. So make sure you delve into the car and its history, and also check for reviews of the seller, too. Only when you’re 100 per cent happy, do the deal – and enjoy the comfort, refinement and low running costs electric cars have to offer. How we tested As with all our car tests, we start by understanding the needs of the buyer – and in the secondhand market there are different priorities, especially around reliability and build quality. So we’ve looked into all that, while also talking to owners and looking into owner surveys to see if people are happy with their cars after a period of time living with them. Value also comes into it – cars depreciate at different rates and what might not be the best buy new, can look all the more attractive when it comes to sitting on a used forecourt. Plus, of course, there are still the things that a car has to do for you, so we assess the cars in the real-world situations you’ll drive them in, and check on running costs over a typical ownership period.

The driving experience is okay, with the Zoe offering brisk acceleration and a light, easy-to-drive nature and good visibility that makes it perfect for urban environments. Running costs are one of the Zoe’s strongest points – it’s reasonably efficient and has minimal maintenance requirements. The Zoe is also exempt from road tax and benefits from low insurance costs, making it an affordable option for those on a budget. Overall, the Renault Zoe is a practical, affordable, and reliable electric car that’s perfect for city living, making it a popular choice in the used market. 7. Volkswagen ID.3: From £10,500, Volkswagen.co.uk Best: For fun open image in gallery Volkswagen ID.3 ( Volkswagen ) Independent rating: 7/10 Pros: Good to drive, efficient, loads of space Good to drive, efficient, loads of space Cons: Flawed infotainment system Flawed infotainment system Price: From £10,500 From £10,500 Maximum claimed range: 336 miles 336 miles Maximum charge rate : 125 kW (model year dependent) : 125 kW (model year dependent) Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,264 x 1,809 x 1,564 mm : 4,264 x 1,809 x 1,564 mm Boot space: 385 litres The Volkswagen ID.3 represents a significant shift for VW as it marks the company’s first purpose-built electric vehicle on its new MEB platform. The ID.3 is designed to be the “electric car for the masses,” offering a blend of affordability, practicality, and modern design that appeals to a wide audience. With a range of up to 340 miles in the Pro S version, the ID.3 provides one of the most competitive ranges in its class, making it suitable for both city driving and longer journeys. Early ID. 3s didn’t live up to Volkswagen’s reputation for high-quality interiors – the materials used inside feel cheaper than owners of Volkswagen Golfs, for example, would be used to. The cabin is spacious, with plenty of room for passengers in both the front and rear, and the boot is a practical size, making the ID.3 a great option for families. Read our full Volkswagen ID.3 review Comfort is another area where the ID.3 excels. The ride is smooth and composed, with the suspension doing a good job of absorbing bumps and imperfections in the road. The seats are comfortable and supportive, making long journeys more enjoyable. The ID.3 is also quiet on the move, thanks to its electric powertrain, which enhances the overall comfort level. When it comes to driver appeal, the ID.3 offers a pleasant driving experience, with light and responsive steering and decent acceleration, particularly in the more powerful versions. It’s not a performance car, but it’s enjoyable to drive and feels stable and secure on the road. There are some neat design touches, like the pause and play symbols on the brake and accelerator pedals Running costs for the ID.3 are low, as you’d expect from an electric vehicle, while Volkswagen’s reputation for reliability adds to the appeal, making the ID.3 a solid choice in the used EV market. 8. Tesla Model S: From £13,000, Tesla.com Best: For long range open image in gallery Tesla Model S ( Tesla ) Independent rating: 7/10 Pros: Technology, space, charging network Technology, space, charging network Cons: Build quality, ride comfort Build quality, ride comfort Price: From £13,000 From £13,000 Maximum claimed range: 393 miles 393 miles Maximum charge rate : 250 kW (model year dependent) : 250 kW (model year dependent) Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,970 x 1,964 x 1,445 mm : 4,970 x 1,964 x 1,445 mm Boot space: 793 litres The original Tesla in the UK, the Model S, has set the standard for electric vehicles since its launch. The Model S combines exceptional range, blistering performance on some models, and cutting-edge features in a sleek, sophisticated package. With ranges of up to 405 miles in the Long-Range version, the Model S is still the benchmark for long-distance electric travel – and the prices make it more tempting than ever, especially with a few cars still getting free Supercharging for their owners. Build quality in the Model S has improved significantly over the years, but it had to; early models had some issues with panel gaps and interior fit and finish. The interior is minimalist and modern, with a massive central touchscreen that controls nearly all the car’s functions. The the cabin is spacious and comfortable, with plenty of room for passengers and luggage. Comfort levels in the Model S are mixed with a firm ride on some models. The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the cabin is also very quiet, with minimal wind and road noise, which enhances the overall sense of luxury. Driver appeal is where the Model S truly excels. With its dual-motor all-wheel-drive system and instant torque, the Model S delivers supercar-like acceleration in some models. The handling is also impressive, with precise steering and a low centre of gravity that makes it feel agile and responsive, despite its size. Running costs for the Model S are low, particularly when compared to similarly powerful petrol or diesel vehicles. The all-electric powertrain means low ‘fuel ‘costs, and Tesla’s Supercharger network makes long-distance travel easy and affordable. Tesla’s over-the-air software updates mean that the car’s technology remains up-to-date, adding to its appeal. 9.

Known for its compact size and nimble handling, the Corsa Electric is particularly well-suited to city driving. Owners often praise the car’s smooth and quiet performance, which contrasts favourably with traditional petrol models, while there should be plenty of choice with decent availability on the used market. In terms of reliability, the Corsa Electric generally performs well. The electric motor is known for being dependable, with very few reports of major issues. The battery has shown to maintain good range over time, though it’s wise to check the battery health before purchasing. Vauxhall offers an 8-year or 100,000-mile warranty on the battery, which provides some peace of mind. Read our full Vauxhall Corsa Electric review Build quality is respectable, with a sturdy feel to the interior and exterior. However, some owners have noted that the cabin materials are not as premium as those found in some rivals like the Peugeot e-208. The infotainment system is functional but can be slightly slow, especially on older models. Owners typically report a positive ownership experience, appreciating the low running costs and ease of driving. The Corsa’s compact dimensions make parking straightforward, and its range is generally sufficient for daily commuting. 10. Kia EV6: From £24,500, Kia.com Best: For style open image in gallery Kia EV6 ( Kia ) Independent rating: 6/10 Pros: Generous warranty, great style, fast charging Generous warranty, great style, fast charging Cons: Firm ride, limited headroom Firm ride, limited headroom Price: From £24,500 From £24,500 Maximum claimed range: 328 miles 328 miles Maximum charge rate : 235 kW : 235 kW Seats: 5 5 Dimensions : 4,695 x 1,890 x 1,550 mm : 4,695 x 1,890 x 1,550 mm Boot space: 490 litres Another Kia on our list and not just because of the remains of the seven-year warranty that used buyers will benefit from. The EV6 is a sporty, spacious hatchback that has persuaded many premium car owners to switch to Kia. And it’s easy to see why with great looks and a smart interior that’s packed with tech. You might find headroom a little tight in the front, but there’s loads of space in the back, while the boot is an okay size, if not enormous. Kia has made great strides in quality in recent years and the EV6 is the perfect example. The brand’s reputation for reliability is building strongly, too. We’d avoid the fast and four-wheel drive versions unless that’s what you really want – the rear-wheel drive car offers the best blend of value and range, and it’s still great to drive despite the car’s weight. The payoff for sporty handling is a rather firm ride, though. Fast charging at an appropriate public charger is a real bonus, as is a level of equipment inside even the more basic models, with every car getting a good roster of safety kit, too. The EV6 is far from the cheapest used EV you can get, but the benefit of that warranty means you’ll have even less to worry about than on rival used models. Electric car FAQs Are electric cars cheaper to run? When it comes to ‘fuel’ and maintenance, yes they are. They can still be expensive to buy – unless you can get a good deal – and insurance can be a bit pricier at the moment, but prices are coming down for both. Are electric cars actually better for the environment? With zero emissions from usage, they are far better for the local environment. How long do electric cars last on full charge? It depends on the size of the battery and car. Currently ranges of new EVs go from around 120 miles up to over 400 miles. Will electric cars get any cheaper? They already are – the Dacia Spring costs from £14,995. Prices and leasing deals are getting more affordable Which electric car brands are most reliable? All electric cars tend to be more reliable than petrol or diesel cars as they have fewer moving parts. Nissan – which launched the first EV – has a good reputation for reliability. The verdict: Electric cars Buying a used electric car isn’t the worry it once was. In fact, the increase in the number of people buying a used EV is currently outstripping those buying new. Worries about the longevity of batteries are a thing of the past. As you can see in our Should You Buy A Used EV video, we drove a Tesla Model S that was over nine years old, had covered over 250,000 miles and still had 84 per cent of its original battery capacity left. That’s not unusual – Tesla told us of all the cars it sells under its certified pre-Owned programme, they never see a car under three-years old with less than 90 per cent of its capacity. So it’s no surprise to see a couple of Teslas on this list: the Model 3 and the Model S represent the best value due to the sheer numbers available, although we could see the Tesla Model Y joining the list at some stage. It’s one of the original EVs that tops the list – the BMW i3. The little i3 is still a sensational car today and proves how ahead of its time. Even the early model with the smaller battery and a range of around 100 miles is perfect for zipping around towns and cities. We’ve got perfect family models here, like the Kia Niro and the Renault Zoe, and if you fancy a bit of luxury, the Jaguar I-Pace is great value right now. Another one of the originals, the Nissan Leaf also makes our list, while there are newer models like the Kia EV6 and Volkswagen ID. 3 that are popular enough used to be great secondhand buys. So the bargains are out there, and if you’re on a smart energy tariff like E.ON Next Drive, running costs can be super-low, too.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a comprehensive list of top used electric vehicles to consider in 2024, highlighting different options based on various use cases such as city driving, family suitability, technology features, and luxury.

Drive smarter and cut costs using our expert advice. Get our Cars newsletter – it's free, monthly Best hybrid cars A hybrid car combines a petrol engine (or, occasionally, a diesel) with an electric motor. To maximise efficiency, energy that would usually be lost as heat when decelerating and braking is recovered to a battery which, in turn, powers the electric motor. They are typically most effective in urban scenarios, where stop-start driving maximises the potential for energy recovery and low speeds allow most models (excluding 'mild' hybrids) to be driven solely on electricity, though normally only for short distances. Furthermore, they’re cheaper to buy than a comparable full-electric model and get around the inconvenience of charging times and limited range. From a driver perspective, a full hybrid car is no different to own and operate than a conventional petrol car, although to get the best out of it you will need to adapt your driving style with a focus on gentle braking and acceleration. One of the major benefits of hybrid cars is reduced fuel consumption. It’s even more noticeable with PHEVs, which can often complete daily drives on electric alone. We measure real-world fuel consumption in multiple scenarios, so you know how much each car costs to run. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert Plug-in hybrid models (PHEVs) offer greater electric driving range (typically around 20-50 miles), thanks to a larger battery. The idea is that you can do most of your day-to-day driving on electricity alone, while having the flexibility of a petrol engine for longer trips. However, to get anywhere near their impressive fuel-economy claims, you’ll need to keep the battery topped up as much as possible. Our tests have revealed that once it’s depleted, a PHEV can be less economical than a comparable petrol-only model. Popular hybrid models include the Toyota Corolla, Honda Jazz, Kia Niro Hybrid, Honda Civic and Toyota RAV4. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best hybrid cars or see our pick of the best hybrid SUVs. Best electric cars Smooth, cheap and emission-free driving is the dream that electric cars promise to fulfil, and there are plenty of models out there that offer exactly that. But they aren’t for everyone. All but the very largest EVs won’t go as far on a single charge as a conventional fossil fuel-powered car, and charging times are longer than a quick fill-up at a service station. Electric cars can be extremely cheap to run, but only if you charge from home. And although the upfront cost of EVs can be high, the UK’s Zero Emissions Vehicle Mandate (ZEV) requires a certain proportion of manufacturers’ car sales to be EVs, meaning there are some huge discounts to be found on new or nearly-new EVs. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert One issue you may want to consider is access to charging facilities. Unless you have a private home charger, you’ll be reliant on the more expensive public charging network – something to consider, particularly if you’re drawn to EVs for their potential cost savings. Find out more in our guide to EV charging costs. If you're concerned about the reliability of EVs, the Which? car survey collates the ownership experience of thousands of owners to find out just how reliable their cars are. The information we collect informs our reviews; if a car is known to break down often, it can’t be a Best Buy. Popular electric models include the Nissan Leaf, Kia Niro EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Volkswagen ID.4. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best electric cars or check out our guide to the cheapest electric cars and best small electric cars. Best small cars The traditional small hatchback remains a firm favourite among UK motorists, and it’s not hard to see why. The best models offer decent practicality, including comfortable seating for four, in a package that’s easy to park in a tight spot, with relatively low running and maintenance costs. Small cars can be deceptively spacious. Some have clever designs that create surprisingly roomy interiors. Our lab tests measure available cabin and boot space across all cars, which often differ from manufacturer claims. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert This is the car class where you are more likely to see compromises, though. Some models do without key safety equipment, such as centre airbags, which makes them more likely to perform poorly in crash tests, rendering them a Don’t Buy. Popular small cars include the Honda Jazz, Skoda Fabia, Vauxhall Corsa, Ford Fiesta, Citroën C3 and Toyota Yaris. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best small cars. Best medium cars Before the meteoric rise of crossover SUVs, the conventional medium-sized hatchback was the go-to family car. They’re consummate all-rounders that aren’t difficult to drive or park, while also offering long-distance driving comfort and sufficient space and practicality for everyday family life. Buying a medium-sized car is one of the cheapest ways to get behind the wheel of a new model with a premium badge, although we’ve found plenty of examples in our annual survey where high-end marques have produced cheaper models that have turned out to be unreliable. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert Our lab tests show there's a vast difference between the best and the worst, though. Read our reviews to find a medium-sized car that scores well for fuel economy, interior quality and – critically – passenger safety. Popular models include the Volkswagen Golf, Vauxhall Astra, Mercedes A-Class, BMW 1 Series and Toyota Corolla. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best medium-sized cars. Best large cars As you’d expect, interior space in a large car shouldn't be an issue, and sizeable engines mean the extra weight won’t make for sluggish performance. But while you’d expect all ‘large’ cars to have plenty of passenger and luggage space, our lab tests show not all of them deliver on their promise. Unlike car manufacturers' own space claims, our expert tests measure only truly usable space to help you compare the cars on your shortlist. While once-popular large models from brands like Ford and Vauxhall are no longer available to buy new, there are still plenty of high-quality large cars from other brands. They also tend to be very well-equipped. Dino Buratti Which? cars expert We test to see how well each seat is padded, looking in depth at lumbar, thigh and head support, so you know whether a car will give you backache after a long drive or protect you from whiplash in the event of a rear-end collision. Popular large cars include the Toyota Prius, Tesla Model 3, BMW 3 Series and VW Passat. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best large cars. Best small SUVs and crossovers The best small SUVs have oodles of cabin space while being as easy to drive as smaller cars, and offer a commanding view of the road. To make sure visibility is good, we use a 360-degree rotating camera to measure exactly how much the driver can see, because huge door pillars and small rear windows can make parking a nightmare. Sensors, cameras and fully automated parking technology are increasingly common, but these extras shouldn’t come at the expense of a well-designed cabin. Don’t be wooed by some of the low-cost crossovers, because sometimes you really do get what you pay for. We’ve found Don’t Buy small SUVs that are light on in-car tech and safety equipment. Michael Passingham Which? cars expert You’ll also need to choose carefully to find a model that offers real practicality benefits over a regular hatchback. We accurately measure everything from head and legroom, through to usable boot space. Popular small SUVs and crossovers include the BMW X1, Hyundai Kona, Ford Puma, Nissan Juke and Kia Niro. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best small SUV and crossover cars. Best large SUVs and 4x4s They're typically big and spacious inside, but the interiors of large SUVs and 4x4s vary wildly. When determining the amount of interior space, we don’t just get in and stretch our legs – we use dummies to work out exactly how much head, leg and knee space each occupant will have. Sheer size doesn’t necessarily translate to great usability. Our tests have revealed models that can perform poorly in emergency manoeuvres and can sometimes be more hazardous in collisions with pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. Michael Passingham Which? cars expert Don’t forget to sit in all the seats when you buy an SUV; sometimes the back seats are more cramped than the front. This is particularly true of coupé-style SUVs, because the sloping roofs can significantly diminish rear headroom. So unless you're planning on rarely using the rear seats, spare a thought for your passengers and read our reviews before you make a shortlist. Popular models in the large SUV class include the Skoda Enyaq, BMW X5, Volvo XC90, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best large SUV and 4x4 cars. Best estate cars The best estates offer truly cavernous boots. Don’t get caught out by the manufacturers’ claims, though; some companies remove carpets and include the space designated for a spare tyre when measuring and reporting boot capacity. We use foam blocks to measure usable space, which give a more realistic figure as they ignore the small nooks that nothing practical can fit into. There’s more to consider than just a large boot. If an estate is high off the ground or has a raised loading lip between the boot sill and floor, it may be difficult to load, especially if you’re carting heavy items around. Also, think about which nice-to-haves you’d like, such as an automatic boot opener, interior lighting and cubbies for essentials. Popular estates include the VW Golf estate, Skoda Superb estate, Volvo V90 and BMW 5 Series Touring. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best estate cars. Best MPVs and people carriers They’re something of a dying breed, but there are still a number of great new MPVs available across a range of fuel types. The best offer decent boot space when all seats are occupied. As with other car classes, we check to see how well MPVs cope with an emergency hazard-avoidance manoeuvre. We swerve around objects at up to 56mph to make sure a car remains stable and controllable, even under extreme conditions. Our testing has found cars that can’t handle sharp turns at high speeds and can skid to the point where you’ve effectively lost control of the vehicle, which can lead to serious accidents. Some MPVs have sliding doors that can make it easier to get in and out, particularly in cramped parking spaces. However, we’ve found that some large MPVs have heavy sliding doors that some passengers may find difficult to open and close, or that can slide back on inclines, potentially posing a risk of injury. Popular people carriers include the Citroën C4 Picasso, Ford S-Max and Volkswagen Touran. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best MPVs. Best 7-seater cars Having lots of seats is all well and good, but if the car is cramped and hard to get into, those extra seats aren’t much use. The best 7-seaters have a sizable boot and won't be cramped, even when all the seats are in use. We also check to see how easy it is to enter any car, which can be a real consideration if you or a family member has mobility issues. If you have young children and need space for more than one child car seat, make sure you check which seats are suitable. Our reviews will highlight where car seats will and won’t fit, and we’ll also say where it’s possible to fit them side-by-side. Popular models available with seven seats include the BMW X7, Skoda Kodiaq, VW Touran and Ford S-Max. See the top-scoring models in our guide to the best 7-seater cars. We test cars more thoroughly than anyone else Our tests go further than those carried out by other organisations and, because Which? is independent, you can trust our reviews to give you the full, honest and impartial truth about every car we test. Every car we review is subjected to more than 300 individual tests in a lab, on a test track and on real roads, allowing us to report accurate miles-per-gallon figures that you can rely on. We also include a motorway test – something that official tests don't cover. Testing in controlled lab conditions means the results we collect are directly comparable between different cars, helping us determine which models are better so you can find the perfect vehicle for your needs. And so you know which models are likely to prove reliable for years to come, we also gather feedback from thousands of UK car owners through the annual Which? car survey and use it to generate detailed reliability ratings for the cars we test.

November 2024 | Moritz Diethelm Kia feiert mit seinen E-Autos der EV-Serie weltweit Verkaufserfolge. Doch das war bislang kein billiges Vergnügen. Mit dem kompakten Alleskönner EV3 will Kia den Einstieg in die EV-Welt nun deutlich klar unter 40.000 Euro drücken. EFAHRER.com hat den EV3 einem ersten Test unterzogen. Artikel teilen Artikel teilen Artikel teilen In die Zwischenablage kopiert Fazit: Genialer Kompakt-Stromer zum guten Preis Der EV3 ist ein rundum gelungener Kompaktstromer, der mit futuristischem Design, gutem Raumangebot, praktischer Auslegung und guter Reichweite und günstigen elektrischen Verbräuchen glänzt. Besonders seine fair bepreiste Basisvariante ab rund 36.000 Euro verdient Anerkennung. Allerdings muss man beim Basismodell mit Frontantrieb, Lithium-Eisenphosphat-Akku und sparsamer Ausstattung auch kleinere Kompromisse eingehen. Schmankerl wie Allrad, eine GT-Sportvariante und 22 kW AC-Ladeleistung möchte Kia 2026 nachreichen. Das dürfte dann allerdings erheblich teurer werden. Anzeige Für wen ist der Kia EV3 das richtige Auto? Die Konkurrenz des EV3 ist knallhart. Der Basis-EV3 kostet rund 36.000 Euro, tritt etwa gegen Skodas noch etwas günstigeres Kompakt-SUV Elroq an. Der EV3 Long Range mit dem großen Akku spielt mit rund 48.000 Euro allerdings preislich gleich in der Liga von VW ID.4 und Tesla Model Y. Der EV3 spricht mit seiner praktischen Auslegung, seinem vergleichsweise erschwinglichen Basis-Preis und den guten Verbräuchen und Reichweiten Familien mit bis zu zwei, auch älteren Kindern an, die in der Verbrennerwelt etwa einen Passat gefahren wären. Gute Fahrdynamik und moderne Technik und Ausstattung machen ihn aber auch für junge Paare und Singles mit größerem Platzbedarf interessant. Kia EV3: Vorteile und Nachteile im Überblick Vorteile Gute Raumökonomie effizienter Antrieb High-Tech-Ausstattung möglich fairer Einstiegspreis Hoher Alltagsnutzen (Frunk, Anhängerkupplung, Dachträger) komfortables Fahrwerk Gute Verarbeitung Vehicle-to-X-fähig Nachteile Unterdurchschnittliche Ladeleistung Knapp bemessener LFP-Akku in der Basis Frontantrieb Anzeige Technische Daten: Kia EV3 Long Range Standard Range Motor Elektro Elektro Leistung 150 kW / 204 PS 150 kW / 204 PS Beschleunigung 0 – 100 km/h 10,6 Sekunden 7,6 Sekunden Höchstgeschwindigkeit 170 km/h 170 km/h Akkupaket 81,4 kWh 58,3 kWh Antrieb Front Front Reichweite 605 km 436 km Normverbrauch 14,9 kWh / 100 km 14,9 kWh / 100 km Ladevolumen 460 – 1.251 Liter 460 – 1.251 Liter Leergewicht 1.885 kg 1.800 kg Maße 4.300 x 1.850 x 1.560 mm 4.300 x 1.850 x 1.560 mm Preis ab 41.390 Euro ab 35.990 Euro Kia EV3: Warum ist dieser Koreaner fast unschlagbar? Außen wirkt der EV3 futuristisch und kantig, ist mit 4,30 Metern allerdings ein kompakter Crossover in der Größe zwischen dem Kia Niro und Soul, die er beerbt – den e-Niro hat Kia bereits vom Markt genommen. Trotz seiner kompakten Maße bietet der Kia EV3 ausreichend Platz für Fahrer und Passagiere. Die Rücksitze sind bequem, auch für Erwachsene, und bieten genügend Beinfreiheit. Mit einem Kofferraumvolumen von 460 Litern und einem zusätzlichen 25-Liter-Frunk (das ist der Kofferraum vorn, wo beim Verbrenner üblicherweise ein Motor ist) bietet der EV3 ausreichend Platz für den Alltag. Durch das Umklappen der Rücksitzlehnen lässt sich das Ladevolumen sogar auf bis zu 1.251 Liter erweitern. Anhängerkupplung und Dachträger machen den EV3 zum Alltagshelden. Seine Vorgänger sticht er damit klar aus, mit dem Skoda Elroq liegt er auf Augenhöhe. Kia EV3 Interieur: Innenraum und Verarbeitung Das Design des Innenraums ist minimalistisch. Die Materialien sind sinnvoll gewählt, wertig und gut verarbeitet. Das Cockpit präsentiert sich mit einer angenehmen Haptik dank genarbter und teilweise unterschäumter Kunststoffoberflächen. Die Topversion ""GT Line"" beeindruckt mit einem futuristischen Cockpit: Drei Bildschirme, die sich zu einer nahezu nahtlosen 30-Zoll-Einheit verbinden, dominieren das Interieur. Die Bedienung erfolgt intuitiv über das übersichtliche Menü, das auch ohne tiefgehende E-Auto-Expertise leicht zu durchschauen ist. Praktische analoge Bedienelemente für die Klimaanlage ergänzen die digitalen Schnittstellen. Zwischen den Vordersitzen mit Liegefunktion ist ein verstellbarer Tisch. Statt mit einem Schlüssel lässt sich der EV3 auch per Smartphone entsperren. Außerdem zeigt Kia eine Chat-GPT-Implementierung für die Sprachsteuerung, die sogar fahrkontextbezogen reagiert und etwa Tipps fürs Wetter, Routen, Restaurants und Lademöglichkeiten geben kann. Kia EV3: Fahrdynamik und Leistung Das Fahrwerk ist komfortabel abgestimmt und schluckt auch grobe Unebenheiten gut weg. Mit 204 PS an der Front ist der EV3 gut, aber im Konkurrenzumfeld nicht übertrieben motorisiert. Hier ist man souverän, aber ohne sportliche Ambition unterwegs. Seine Leistung bringt der EV3 im Fahrtest gut genug auf den trockenen Asphalt. Bei e-Niro und e-Soul war die Traktion noch ein großer Kritikpunkt. Die VW-Konzernautos mit ihrem Heckantrieb haben aber einen prinzipiellen Vorteil und sind auch für noch höhere Leistungen gerüstet. Die Assistenzsysteme funktionieren zuverlässig und sorgen für zusätzlichen Komfort und Sicherheit und erleichtern das Fahren in der Praxis. Serienmäßig ist eine navigationsbasierte Geschwindigkeitsregelanlage mit Stop-and-go-Funktion, Autobahnassistent, ein intelligenter Geschwindigkeitsassistent, Frontkollisionswarner 1.5 mit Fußgänger- und Radfahrererkennung sowie eine Abbiegefunktion, Spurhalte- und Spurfolgeassistent, Fernlichtassistent und ein Fahrerüberwachungssystem verbaut. Die Ansammlung von Warntönen nervt schnell, das Gebimmel lässt sich aber einfach per langem Druck auf die Lautstärketaste am Lenkrad abschalten oder mit ein paar Klicks im Menü individuell anpassen. Der Kia EV3 ist der erste Hyundai-Konzernwagen mit iPedal 3.0. Dieses System ermöglicht intelligentes Rekuperieren und One-Pedal-Driving mit drei Stufen plus Segelmodus. Das ist auf der kurzen Testfahrt etwas umständlich zu konfigurieren, ermöglicht dem Besitzer aber eine sehr genaue Anpassung der automatischen Rekuperation an Fahrervorlieben und Straßengegebenheiten. Viele E-Auto-Kunden wollen genau das, die Erfahrung zum Beispiel mit den aktuellen BMW-Elektroautos zeigt aber, dass eine intelligente, voll adaptive Rekuperationssteuerung ohne Konfigurationsmöglichkeiten in der Praxis mindestens ebenso gut und effizient arbeitet. Kia EV3: Reichweite und Verbrauch Zur Wahl stehen Akkus mit 58 kWh oder 81 kWh Kapazität. Die Basis kommt nur mit einfacheren LFP-Akkus. Die WLTP-Reichweite gibt Kia mit 410 bzw. 605 km an. Die angezeigten Stromverbräuche im Bordcomputer lagen bei unserer Testfahrt bei optimalen 20 Grad Außentemperatur und Landstraßengeschwindigkeiten mit unter 15 kWh pro 100 km meist spielend leicht auf dem Niveau der Herstellerangaben. Wie der EV3 auf der Langstrecke und bei Autobahngeschwindigkeiten mit dem Strom auskommt, muss der EFAHRER-Volltest zeigen. Kia EV3 Schnellladen: Ohne 800-Volt-Turbo langsamer als die VW-Konkurrenz Laden geht nicht mit den irren Geschwindigkeiten von EV6 und EV9 – weil dem EV3 die 800-Volt-Technik der großen Brüder fehlt. Mit maximal 100 kW und einer halben Stunde Ladedauer für das Laden von 10 auf 80 Prozent hält das Basismodell mit den Basis-VWs mit. Der 81-kWh-Akku verdaut maximal 128 kW und liegt damit spürbar schlechter als die 77-kWh-Varianten des deutschen Konkurrenten: Die laden mit bis zu 175 kW. Wie die VWs ist der EV3 vorbereitet für Vehicle-to-X, kann wie eine große Powerbank seinen Strom also auch ans Netz, ans Haus oder einen Stromverbraucher abgeben. Ein ganzes Haus auf diese Art zu versorgen ist zwar noch Zukunftsmusik, per einfachem Adapter aber eine vollwertige 230-Volt-Steckdose dabeizuhaben, ist zum Beispiel fürs Camping richtig cool. An einer privaten Wallbox lädt die große Batterie in etwa 7 Stunden und 15 Minuten vollständig auf, die kleine in rund 5 Stunden und 20 Minuten - beide aktuell nur mit 11 kW. Eine 22-kW-Option, die vor allem das Laden an öffentlichen Wechselstrom-Ladesäulen beschleunigt, will Kia 2026 anbieten.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a detailed review of the Kia EV3, touching on various aspects such as design, pricing, features, and technical specifications.

The lack of pistons and noisy combustion means electric cars can ghost along very quietly at city speeds, and they tend to be very nippy. The surprising turn of speed from a standstill can take the uninitiated by surprise, so make sure you take it slowly the first few times you drive one. The lack of noise can seem peculiar at first, as can be the total absence of engine vibration, but these are two big advantages of driving an electric car. The basics of driving an electric car are the same as any other car. There's still an accelerator and a brake pedal. But in other ways an electric car can seem strange to a seasoned driver. Some models, including the Nissan Leaf, can be driven using just one pedal. So when you lift off the accelerator, the car uses heavy regenerative braking to slow down the car significantly (enough to illuminate the brake lights) and feed energy back into the battery. It can take a little time to get used to and there's still a separate brake if you'd prefer to drive conventionally. How should you charge an electric car? Unless you don't use your car that often, don't even think about using a domestic three-pin socket to charge your car. This is slow. Very slow. We're talking in excess of 35 hours' worth of slow, depending on the car. For regular charging at home, if your property allows it, you'll be best off investing in a dedicated fast charger. This normally takes the form of a wallbox mounted on the outside of your house. The type of charger, connector and wattage you need will depend on your car, budget and what electricity connection you have. When you're away from home, you can use websites or apps to find out where your nearest public charging point is. These include on-street charging points in city centres, for example, as well as the growing number of high-voltage fast chargers and rapid chargers at strategic service stations on the motorway network. Currently, charging points are run by a variety of separate networks, so you’ll need to work out which ones are compatible with your car, and register with them accordingly. And bear in mind that some public charging points can be very costly when compared with rates for home charging. See our dedicated guide on how much it costs to charge an electric car for all you need to know. Which electric cars have the longest range? If you're planning to buy an electric car, check the maximum range of the electric cars in your shortlist, especially if you regularly drive long distances. And don't forget to factor in your charging time, too, if you need to top up at any time other than overnight. The maximum driving range available can vary greatly between models. Luxury models with larger batteries offer greater claimed driving ranges, but even entry-level models should offer a driving range of around 150-250 miles. However, don't just look at the official figures. At Which? we do our own realistic range tests because, just like fuel tests, the figure manufacturers quote are often quite ambitious. We've found cars that fall more than 100 miles short of their quoted range. If you don't want to be caught out, make sure you check out the real, independently tested ranges in our electric car reviews. We test cars more thoroughly than anyone else Our tests go further than those carried out by other organisations, and because Which? is independent, you can trust our reviews to give you the full, honest and impartial truth about every car we test.

Determining which of these is best for you, however, is an exercise in itself. So, how do you pick the right car for you? Start by considering a series of questions ... What Kind of Car Do I Need? Figuring out the body style that meets your needs is overwhelming on its own. What exactly makes a car a coupe, convertible﻿﻿, sedan, hatchback, station wagon, SUV, pickup truck, or van﻿? How do you decide what you need? Coupe﻿﻿/Convertible﻿: If you want a car that makes a statement about you, coupes and convertibles﻿ are typically the most expressive designs, but restricted access to the back seat (if the car you are considering even has one) seriously limits their practicality. Sedan﻿: If there are kids in the picture or in the near-future plan, four doors are a likely requirement. Even if children are small enough to ride comfortably in the back seat of a coupe with any regularity, consider the difficulty of constantly climbing into and out of the back seat to tend to a child before committing to just two doors. Hatchback﻿: If you add another door—bringing the total to five—you’re looking at hatchbacks and station wagons, which offer loads of space without the dynamic and fuel-economy compromises of a heavier SUV. Station Wagon﻿: Station wagons have perhaps the worst reputation of any body style on the market, but we’re fighting to change that. They offer the best attributes of a car without the trade-offs of larger crossovers and SUVs. SUV/Crossover﻿: Jack up the ground clearance of a hatchback or station wagon, and you have a crossover or an SUV. Do you need that ground clearance? Probably not. When was the last time your road didn’t get regularly plowed or cleared? Sure, it happens—most often to those of us in the northern part of the country, and that’s a few times a winter—but the fuel-economy penalty of opting for a taller and heavier vehicle is something that affects you every time you start the car. Of course, the higher seating position of a crossover or SUV is something many people enjoy, for its increased visibility and for the ease of entry and exit as the seat is at a more natural height. But keep in mind that height adds weight, and weight diminishes fuel economy and stability. ﻿Pickup Truck﻿: Those who tow or haul heavy loads regularly already know they need something with the capability to take on these jobs. But if you need a truck only to tow or haul a big load a few times a year, perhaps renting one in those instances is a better alternative to living year-round with the fuel-economy penalties of these often big machines. Van/Minivan﻿: Those with large families—or dreams of such—often resist the practicality of the van, but if you routinely haul five or more people, there is no vehicle short of a school bus that will better accommodate six, seven, or eight passengers. A jumbo SUV such as a Chevrolet Suburban or Ford Expedition Max has more cargo space, but passengers may find greater comfort in a minivan. A minivan is the perfect family vehicle but normally does without any semblance of soul. A couple of notable exceptions are the Honda Odyssey and the Chrysler Pacifica, both of which manage to add an element of driving pleasure to the normally bland character associated with this class of family hauler.﻿﻿ What Size Car Do I Need? We say start small. And right off the bat, let’s debunk a common myth: Larger vehicles are safer than smaller ones. The safest collision is one you avoid in the first place. Lighter cars are typically more agile and give you a better chance of steering away from a crash rather than gripping the wheel, barreling in, and letting physics punish the other driver. Illustration by Pete Sucheski | Car and Driver Before the inevitable “If I’m going to get T-boned by an idiot in a Navigator, I’d rather be in a Silverado than a Mini” response, consider that a shorter stopping distance might allow you to come to a complete stop before either car in that scenario ever enters the intersection. Small cars tend to cost less to buy and consume less fuel, too. Driving a smaller, more frugal car makes you look enlightened—at least in college towns and northern California. Do I Need All-Wheel Drive? Probably not. All-wheel drive is seen as a safety feature in wintry climes, but the only difference the average driver will notice with all-wheel drive is the added traction when accelerating. All-wheel drive doesn’t increase a vehicle’s ability to stop or turn. Most buyers don’t realize how much difference a set of winter tires can make. And they are often cheaper than upgrading to an all-wheel-drive car nor will they have the year-round negative impact on your fuel economy that comes with a car having to drive all four wheels all the time. Toyota While we’re on the subject, a weightier vehicle does not automatically make for a better winter vehicle. Heavy cars and trucks do plow through deep snow better and behave more predictably in the white stuff, but if you hit a patch of ice, then that weight is just extra momentum you have to try and control. Again, bigger is not necessarily better. How Much Power Do I Need? In our road tests, we always cite acceleration times to 60 mph, but the fact is that very few people ever actually pin the right pedal to the floorboard regularly. Truck buyers who tow and haul heavy loads need lots of power, but the average car buyer doesn’t need any more than is necessary to keep them comfortable on a test drive. The buying practice of getting the bigger engine but never using more than half of the accelerator's travel is like building a four-story house but leaving the top two floors vacant. All else being equal, larger engines use more fuel. What About Hybrids and Electric Vehicles? The type of driving you do determines whether or not a hybrid or an electric vehicle makes sense for you. Hybrids tend to use less fuel around town, where low speeds and frequent braking keep them running on battery power longer. Electric vehicles are good for buyers who live in areas where public charging infrastructure is robust. Electric vehicles can be taken on road trips, but may require a bit of additional planning to account for charging speeds and charger locations. Roy Ritchie | Car and Driver Plug-in hybrids (or PHEVs)﻿, meanwhile, combine aspects of both hybrid and electric vehicles. With larger battery packs that take charge from either the grid or the onboard internal combustion engine, PHEVs can travel multiple miles on battery power alone. Run through the pack's charge, and the gas engine comes into play, allowing the vehicle to operate as a typical hybrid. Due to the extra weight of their larger capacity battery packs, PHEVs are often less fuel-efficient than their lighter hybrid counterparts. Nonetheless, a PHEV may be the right option for the sort of person who regularly drives short distances throughout their day (thus allowing them to putter about on cheaper and cleaner electricity alone), but also dreams of going on the occasional road trip without having to plan their route around our nation's still-growing charging infrastructure. Whatever approach you take ought to save you money on fuel relative to the strictly gas-powered equivalent vehicle, but be aware of the premiums you’ll be paying up front and the distance you’ll have to drive to recoup your costs. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily have to be a deterrent if you know you’ll drive a car more than 60,000 or 100,000 miles, or if you buy a fuel miser on principle.﻿",Uncategorized,bing,"The article titled ""What's the Right New Vehicle for Me?"" primarily offers a guide on selecting the most suitable vehicle based on individual needs and preferences, such as body style, size, and power requirements.

First Drive: Kia’s EV3 is a polished addition to the electric car segment,"The new EV3 is the latest addition to Kia’s ever-widening line-up of electric vehicles, but what is it like to drive? Jack Evans has been finding out.",https://www.expressandstar.com/news/motors/2024/11/10/first-drive-kias-ev3-is-a-polished-addition-to-the-electric-car-segment/,,2024-11-10 23:17:00,Express & Star,,"What is it? (Kia) But this car – the new EV3 – arrives with a lot of competition in its midst. The likes of the Volvo EX30 and Volkswagen ID.3 lie in its path, while newcomers like the upcoming Skoda Elroq have their sights set on this Hyundai. But with this brand having a lot of learnings in this area, can the EV3 deliver? We’ve been driving it to find out. What’s new? (Kia) But importantly, Kia has equipped the EV3 with much of the same technology that you’d get on its bigger brothers. Features such as heated seats, a widescreen infotainment setup and lots of eco-friendly materials come equipped as standard, while its 460-litre boot resoundingly trumps those that you’ll find in many of the EV3’s key rivals. There’s a handy ‘frunk’ up in the nose of the car for storing charging cables, too. What’s under the bonnet? (Kia) Performance-wise, a 201bhp electric motor on both versions means a 0-60mph time of just under eight seconds for either model. There’s also the option for full one-pedal driving on the EV3 – whereby the car automatically starts to slow down when you lift off the accelerator – which can be useful for when driving around town or in stop-start traffic. What’s it like to drive? It’s the refinement of the EV3 which is noticeable above all other characteristics. It’s comfortable and well-damped over lumps and bumps, transforming this relatively compact car into one which feels more grown-up than you might expect. It’s quiet, too, even at motorway speeds and this helps to give the EV3 a well-rounded character. Visibility is generally good – aside from the rather chunky rear pillars blocking your over-the-shoulder view – and it’s nice that you’ve got a ‘proper’ rear wiper since so many alternatives do without one. The steering isn’t the most feel-packed, but it’s certainly accurate enough to allow you to place the car just where you want it. But it really is that refinement and comfort-focused suspension which shines through in the EV3 driving experience. How does it look? (Kia) A trio of specifications allow you to tweak the look of the EV3, too, with GT-Line versions standing out through their standard-fit 19-inch alloy wheels and privacy glass. There’s a cool ‘pistachio’ shade to pick as well, which does add a quirky edge to the EV3’s aesthetic. What’s it like inside? (Kia) Rear-seat space isn’t half bad, either. Headroom might be a little tight for taller adults, but for most people it’ll suit just fine while leg and foot room is good as well. You’ll find handy USB-C charging points integrated into the backs of the front seats, too, ensuring that there are plenty of top-up options for those sitting in the rear of the car. What’s the spec like? (Kia) In fact, we’d be leaning towards sticking with the entry-level ‘Air’ version and spending extra on the larger battery. The standard car is more than well-equipped enough and gets all of the features you really need. Verdict The Kia EV3 is a very easy car to recommend. It’s more spacious than rivals and offers an impressive amount of range, while its standard equipment list is comprehensive enough to make straying to more costly specifications less important than on other cars. We’ve already seen Kia’s EV6 and EV9 models doing well in their respective size classes and going off this initial drive, it seems that the EV3 should experience the same kind of success.",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article provides a detailed overview of the Kia EV3, focusing on its design, drive performance, and specifications.

Carmakers are scrambling to up their zero-emission sales to comply with increasingly tightening Net Zero laws. 1 Brand are trying to boost EV sales by offering huge discounts Credit: Getty The new Government has confirmed it will reinstate the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 after former PM Rishi Sunak delayed it to 2025. Plenty of firms have already self-imposed earlier deadlines to make the all-electric transition in an attempt to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, Jaguar won't sell a new car in the UK for a whole year as bosses prepare to phase out petrol power altogether in 2026. But every brand is still subject to the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. The legally-binding regulations force manufacturers to ensure that a certain portion of their sales are electric vehicles, with the percentage increasing each year up to the total ban. This year's requirement is 22%, with firms fined up to £1,500 per car they produce over the limit. Already, bosses at Ford have said they will have to make fewer petrol models to balance their stats. However, others are trying to get the EVs flying out the doors by slapping them with heavy discounts. DS, the luxury arm of Citroen, is leading the way, with an average drop of 35.7% on the 3 Crossback. That means that new models are cut from over £37,000 to under £25,000, according to data from AutoTrader. Terrifying moment £50k EV explodes on family's driveway before flames spread to their home MG isn't far behind with a 34% dip for the 5 and 30% for the ZS. Even Tesla, which isn't bound by the Mandate since it only makes EVs, has dropped the Model 3 from £42,000 to £39,000 in the past year. Ian Plummer, commercial director at AutoTrader, commented: ""That sort of discount finally makes it possible for the consumer to make a rational decision to buy an EV, rather than base it on emotional reasons such as environmental factors. ""It’s going to be very painful [for manufacturers]. ""They are going to be selling EVs at a loss in many cases and they will have to arbitrage those losses with the profits they can still make on their diesel and petrol vehicles."" The only issue is that EVs remain stubbornly more expensive on average than their petrol counterparts, despite the discounts. This is largely to do with the costs associated with developing brand new electric platforms, rather than re-using already established internal combustion specs. As a result, brands can only cut prices so much to stimulate demand before losses become unsustainable. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the industry body the SMMT, explained: ""The ZEV mandate compels manufacturers to produce, but it does not compel consumers to buy.""",Business,bing,"The article primarily discusses the current market trend of reduced prices for electric vehicles (EVs) in the UK due to regulatory pressures and a drive to increase zero-emission sales.

You pay a monthly or biannual premium based on the policy you've selected and, if you need to be reimbursed for repairs or other bills, file a claim with your insurance company. Filing a claim can lead to higher premiums, so do it cautiously. Car insurance companies typically offer lower rates and discounts to drivers with clean records, as they're considered less likely to file a claim in the future. Different types of car insurance While there are many available add-ons, there are five basic types of car insurance coverage. At a minimum you'll need liability insurance to drive in most states, though many people add collision and comprehensive coverage — the three combined are referred to as ""full coverage."" Liability coverage: Pays for property damage and bodily injury when you are found responsible for a collision. It is required in most of the country, though the amount differs by state.

Personal injury protection: Pays for your medical expenses and lost income after an accident. Pays for your medical expenses and lost income after an accident. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage: Kicks in if you are involved in an accident with another driver who has no insurance or insufficient coverage. Average cost of car insurance The cost of car insurance varies considerably depending on where you live. Rates are typically higher in no-fault states like New York and Michigan, for example. Average car insurance costs by state State Average annual cost for full coverage Average annual cost for minimum coverage Alabama $2,047 $546 Alaska $2,249 $465 Arizona $2,727 $851 Arkansas $2,302 $464 California $2,645 $631 Colorado $3,022 $551 Connecticut $2,470 $945 Delaware $2,536 $918 Florida $3,450 $1,055 Georgia $2,613 $887 Hawaii $1,548 $376 Idaho $1,326 $340 Illinois $2,134 $682 Indiana $1,683 $424 Iowa $1,827 $317 Kansas $2,528 $589 Kentucky $2,658 $762 Louisiana $3,683 $953 Maine $1,528 $393 Maryland $2,619 $942 Massachusetts $1,725 $456 Michigan $2,976 $844 Minnesota $2,447 $679 Mississippi $2,206 $502 Missouri $2,710 $687 Montana $2,323 $376 Nebraska $2,358 $579 Nevada $3,111 $987 New Hampshire $1,640 $443 New Jersey $2,458 $1,008 New Mexico $2,290 $554 New York $3,757 $1,553 North Carolina $2,057 $611 North Dakota $1,903 $388 Ohio $1,492 $398 Oklahoma $2,713 $537 Oregon $1,939 $771 Pennsylvania $2,461 $521 Rhode Island $2,713 $819 South Carolina $1,847 $587 South Dakota $2,241 $343 Tennessee $2,003 $485 Texas $2,429 $696 Utah $2,088 $785 Vermont $1,396 $301 Virginia $2,121 $688 Washington $1,702 $502 West Virginia $2,083 $538 Wisconsin $1,811 $422 Wyoming $1,709 $260 District of Columbia $2,440 $768 Source: Rates are from Bankrate and are current as of September 2024. What factors affect car insurance rates? Several factors influence the price of car insurance, some of which are under your control and some of which aren't. The amount of coverage: Full coverage is more expensive than a liability-only policy. A low deductible can also raise the price of your premiums, as can buying add-ons like gap insurance and roadside assistance. Full coverage is more expensive than a liability-only policy.

Your driving history: Have an at-fault accident, speeding ticket or DUI on your record makes you a high-risk driver and usually results in pricier premiums. Have an at-fault accident, speeding ticket or DUI on your record makes you a high-risk driver and usually results in pricier premiums. Car make, model and features: A six-figure sports car will cost more to insure than a used sedan. While replacement costs can factor into this difference, discounts for safety features can also play a part. FAQs How much does car insurance cost? The average cost of full coverage car insurance is $2,348 per year., according to Bankrate data, and $639 a year for minimum coverage (or liability-only) insurance. Can you get a refund on your car insurance? Most car insurance is paid on a monthly or bi-annual basis. In most cases, if you cancel a policy you've already paid for, you'll get a pro-rated refund. How do car insurance companies pay out claims? After you file a claim, your insurer will review your documentation and investigate the circumstances of the claim. Depending on the provider, they may either issue you a check directly or send payment to the repair shop or medical provider. Who is considered a high-risk driver? You may be considered a high-risk driver if you have a previous at-fault accident, a history of traffic violations, a DUI or a large number of points on your license. You may also be considered a high-risk driver because of other factors, like being a new driver or having poor credit. What is the actual cash value of my car? If your vehicle is stolen or totaled, your insurance companies will typically pay out the car's actual cash value (ACV), or what it's worth minus depreciation. Standard gap insurance can make sure the balance of your car loan is paid off but if you want enough to buy a new vehicle, you'll need car replacement assistance coverage, which can get you as much as 120% of the car's ACV. What is the cheapest car insurance company? According to our analysis, the major auto insurance companies with the lowest average premiums are USAA, Auto-Owners and Geico. Your individual rate will vary, however, depending on where you live, your driving record and other factors. Why trust CNBC Select?

Mini Cooper Electric review,"Perhaps even harder to believe that the renaissance car is on its fourth generation already, this arguably its most significant upgrade in those years. As a generous treat for electric Mini ...",https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/mini/cooper-electric,,2024-11-08 00:00:00,Top Gear,,"Hard to believe that it's been over 20 years since the new Mini arrived. Perhaps even harder to believe that the renaissance car is on its fourth generation already, this arguably its most significant upgrade in those years. As a generous treat for electric Mini customers, this version is on a new platform, while the petrol one is a heavily reworked version of the old car with similar styling. As has become the norm in the last two decades, the newest Mini is a bit bigger than before (it’s taller and wider but not quite as long), the new Countryman SUV is even bigger and that’s created space for the Aceman small SUV, which might end up jostling with the Cooper for sales. Advertisement - Page continues below Three versions of the Cooper Electric are available: the 181bhp Cooper E (from £30,000), 215bhp SE (from £34,500) and 255bhp John Cooper Works (from £39k). It's up against stuff like the Renault 5, Peugeot e-208, Vauxhall Corsa Electric and Fiat 500. Not so mini anymore, is it? Which is what everyone will say for the first three months of you driving this around. But then none of the Minis built this century have been particularly petite, and indeed none of them have sought to replicate the revolutionary tiny nature of the original. You can’t help feeling nostalgic though, so the new Cooper scratches the itch in some inventive ways while still being fully future-focused. Few cars were as analogue as the original Issigonis-designed Mini, or as ingeniously packaged. Its immense character was in inverse proportion to its diminutive size, but its creator, Sir Alec Issigonis, was ruthless when it came to weight saving. Advertisement - Page continues below BEV porkiness is such an issue that soon our multi-storey car parks will be wilting under the extra pressure. At 1,600kg, the new Mini Cooper Electric is kinda chunky, but it’s actually shorter than the outgoing car, with minimal front and rear overhangs. It’s 3.8m long overall. It does look good though. Design director Oliver Heilmer and his team have instigated a clever evolution of the Mini’s visual language, while preserving its wheel-at-each-corner stance™. The body, window area and floating roof are distinct yet coherent elements (see also that other British ‘icon’, the Range Rover), and the nose receives a new octagonal treatment. The circular headlamps now come with three different light signatures, and the rear lights’ jingoistic union jack motif can be switched out. The whole lot does a welcome and farewell fandango when the car senses the key (or smartphone) as you approach. It's all trying very hard, you'll either love it or hate it. Inside, the car continues to pay tribute to the original while simultaneously being an absolute tech-fest. It’s mostly quite minimalist, with flat air vents, fun use of materials around the dash and handy storage, but the interior is dominated by the slightly crazy 9.4in central circular touchscreen. The sharp OLED number actually works well, bringing character to the car along with a whole heap of, er, complication. See the Interior tab for more. How does it drive? The handling is sharp and enthusiastic, so you can chuck it about with confidence. But the ride is too firm. And you can’t escape the weight of the car, either: BMW Group is generally quite good at disguising heft, but there’s no substitute for just being light in the first place. I need range and performance stats, stat! Time to get sensible. The lower-powered E models (181bhp/214lb ft, 7.3 seconds 0–62mph) come with a 36.6kWh battery that’s officially rated for up to 185 miles of range. That’ll probably come out at around 150 miles in the real world, and is better if you mostly keep to town driving. The more powerful SE (215bhp/243lb ft, 6.7s) gets a larger 49.2kWh battery that’s good for up to 247 miles WLTP; think 210/220 in practice. Strangely, the quicker John Cooper Works (255bhp/258lb ft, 5.9s) is rated up to 250 miles, presumably because its aero stick-ons help with efficiency. Our choice from the range MINI 160kW SE Classic 54kWh 3dr Auto £34,445 See prices and specs What's the verdict? “ The Cooper Electric is firm-riding, but has the handling smarts and eager reactions to make this a trade-off worth tolerating ” Fundamentally, this is a great little car, overflowing with personality. This one just happens to be electric. The Cooper Electric is firm-riding, as so many EVs are, but has the handling smarts and eager reactions to make this a trade-off worth tolerating. The interior tech is occasionally infuriating, but mostly clever and well judged. Need a bit more practicality?

Regarding engagement, the article includes humorous personal insights and a sense of nostalgia for the original Mini, making it more relatable and engaging to potential buyers and fans of the brand.

But then Renault has already sold 400,000 electric vehicles, mostly Zoes, across more than a decade, and they've run six billion miles ...",https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/renault/megane-e-tech-electric,,2024-11-05 11:52:00,Top Gear,,"This is Renault's family hatch. Its full name is Megane E-Tech Electric and that’s because it's designed and built all-in for battery power. There won't be a version with an engine. That frees up the design and proportions, and removes many compromises from the engineering. The Megane is one of a whole flotilla of electric cars from multiple brands, all using versions of the same platform. Renault's Alliance partner uses it for the intriguing Ariya crossover. Alpine will turn it into a high-performance electric crossover coupe. There's already a bigger Renault in the form of the Scenic, and there'll be Mitsubishis too. Advertisement - Page continues below And soon enough the same underduds will spawn the next Nissan Leaf, which will be reinvented as a compact crossover built at Sunderland. At which point the over-used phrase 'no pressure then' looms over the horizon. And it’s had a facelift, right? A mild one. And not in the literal sense: the face, along with the rest of the exterior design, has actually been left well alone. But Renault has introduced one or two new trinkets, including a standard heat pump for better e-efficiency, and a 12in portrait touchscreen on all but the base trim. The adaptive cruise control has got cleverer, and will now slow down for junctions etcetera. Looks a bit crossover-y. The proportions make it hard to judge. But it's just a normal-size family hatch. Actually a little shorter than most. Renault argues this is not an SUV despite the black wheel-arch extensions, and true enough its roof height is lower than a VW ID.3. If you want a petrol or hybrid Renault roughly this size, it's an Arkana for you my friend. Enjoy the mediocrity. Advertisement - Page continues below Using a purpose-designed structure brings the expected benefits to the Megane. It mostly feels roomy and has lots of cabin storage, thanks to a flat floor and long wheelbase. The dash is moved forward because the climate-control tackle is tucked under the bonnet. Renault actually designed two versions of this car: the regular hatch and a sporty one, with widened arches and more aggressive bumpers. Apparently the finance department didn't think much of the latter, but then Renault got a new boss in 2020 and on his second day in the job Luca de Meo said 'just make the sports one'. So the 'base' car was quietly shuffled off to oblivion. Range and power? The Megane is front-drive only, which gives it a bigger boot than the ID.3. 217bhp motor, 60kWh battery, and there’s DC rapid charging up to 130kW. WLTP range is 280 miles. What about the interface? Good question. We've had a lot of beef with EV dashboards: some rely too much on touchscreens, some deprive the driver of a proper instrument panel. But the Megane has both a big twin-screen layout and not-ungenerous rows of physical controls. The screens run on the Android Automotive operating system, but skinned in a Renault-specific way. And if you're an Appleist, it runs CarPlay too. We got on well with it. And on the road? The main impression is of a really mature product. But then Renault has already sold 400,000 electric vehicles, mostly Zoes, across more than a decade, and they've run six billion miles, all connected back to the Renault mothership for analysis of battery and owner behaviour. Renault likes to call the Megane an 'electric GTI'. Which is over-egging things a bit. It lacks the involvement of a good sporty petrol hatch. Still, performance is lively and the steering quick. Multi-link suspension gives it both responsive cornering and a very quiet, refined – although not that soft – ride. It's also efficient on its not-very-large battery, which in turn helps with rapid-recharging time. What's it up against? So, so many things. Another VW Group rival is the Cupra Born, while the MG4 is undoubtedly part of the conversation too. And given the sheer number of small-ish crossover-slash-SUVs out there, it'll no doubt have to fight those for its share of the pie as well. So think Kia Niro EV, Hyundai Kona Electric, Volvo EX30, Peugeot e-2008, Mini Aceman and Jeep Avenger. Heck, you wouldn't put it past some people deciding a Tesla Model 3 is too 'out there' and resorting to one of these instead. Also, if you want to save a bit of money and climb the desirability stakes even more… have you seen the Renault 5? How much does it cost? Here’s the thing, as a result of the facelift the Megane has actually got £500 cheaper. Nope, we can’t work out how either. But from £33,995, it undercuts everything mentioned above save for the Minis and MG4. Full details over on the Buying tab. Our choice from the range RENAULT EV60 160kW Techno 60kWh Optimum Charge 5dr Auto £38,440 See prices and specs What's the verdict? “ The Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, well-finished and easy to use... there's very little wrong with it ” This Renault is slick to drive, so you might briefly be tempted into range-blunting speeds that negate the car's clever efficiency measures. Go sensibly though and the range compromise is enough for most. Back seat space is possibly a little tight for a leggy family, but that's a common issue with electric cars. If it's a dealbreaker for you, get round the problem with the bigger Scenic instead. As for the non-electric parts of it, the Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, and the cabin is well-finished and easy to use. There's very little wrong with it.

Learn More › Cold weather can seep through the walls, linger in the floors, and make a home uncomfortable. But with an electric heater, you can quickly and easily warm up a bedroom, office space, or even your garage. Most of these appliances are relatively compact and plug directly into an outlet for easy setup, but some more permanent installations require you to hardwire them into your electrical system. To see which of these installations is ideal and evaluate other aspects of electric heaters, including ease of use, portability, and even noise, we selected 10 popular models from thousands of available options before testing nine. We used them for heating spaces big and small while recording how much sound they made and measuring the amount of moisture they pulled from the air. Though there’s one model we didn’t have time to test, we still included our pick for the best baseboard heater since we don’t want readers to overlook its efficient, economical heating power. If you’re looking to add an electric heater to your home this winter, it’s smart to start by considering your room size and preferred type of heater, as well as which safety aspects and operational features matter most. We think the Dreo Solaris H3 Slim Space Heater will meet most users’ needs, as it earned a nearly perfect score for its ease of use, performance, portability, noise, and value. To learn more about this model and the situations where another option might be better, read on for product details and test results on the rest of the best electric heaters. Photo: Michelle Larson for Bob Vila Photo: Michelle Larson for Bob Vila Photo: Michelle Larson for Bob Vila Testing Stats Products tested 9 Time spent testing 2 weeks Tests performed 7 Price range $30 to $350 Our Top Picks These recommended electric heaters were selected for quality and price with an eye toward the important considerations outlined at the bottom of this guide. Best Overall Dreo Solaris H3 Slim Space Heater Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4.5/5; Performance 5/5; Portability 5/5; Noise 5/5; Value 4.7/5 Product Specs Type: Ceramic Ceramic Maximum heat output: 1,500 watts 1,500 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 200 square feet What We Like Four heat settings, programmable thermostat, and fan-only operation Unmatched 70-degree oscillation Super quiet at just 37.5 decibels What We Don’t Like Controls are a little less intuitive to use than on other models When you set out to test a bunch of electric heaters and end up using the same one over and over after your tests are done, giving it the award for Best Overall is a pretty easy decision. Still, our quantifiable results back up our opinion, as this slim and small electric heater from Dreo got nearly perfect marks in all categories. It weighs under 5 pounds and is only 15.8 inches tall by 5.9 inches in diameter, yet it had no problem warming up spaces well beyond its 200-square-foot recommended coverage area. It’s also whisper-quiet, competitively priced, and incredibly user-friendly. It has four heat settings, a programmable thermostat, and a fan-only option. It’s also an attractive little heater. Though that’s certainly not the most important aspect of choosing a supplemental appliance, we appreciate that it’s not an eyesore. The heater and fan combo comes in black and gold or black and silver and features a digital display. Unlike our Upgrade Pick, it doesn’t offer integrated cord storage, but it does let you run it without setting a thermostat temperature. This ceramic heater also kept a good amount of moisture in the air, dropping humidity levels less over 3 hours than all other heaters we tested. What our tester says: “This is my favorite electric heater of all the options I tested. I keep it by my desk for chilly mornings, and it warms my toes without taking up much space. Though I love its tall and narrow design, I’m glad it shuts off when it tips over. My dogs seem to have a special ability to run right into it when they come running in to say hi.” —Michelle Larson, Product Reviews tester and writer Get the Dreo electric heater at Amazon, Walmart, or Dreo. Best Bang For the Buck Handy Heater Pure Warmth Electric Heater Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4/5; Performance 5/5; Portability 5/5; Noise 4/5; Value 5/5 Product Specs Type: Thermo-ceramic Thermo-ceramic Maximum heat output: 1,200 watts 1,200 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 250 square feet What We Like Has a multi-color LED night light Internal filter removes odors and dust from the air Automatic shut-off when knocked over or picked up What We Don’t Like Doesn’t have a thermostat Louder than advertised Though it’s one of the smallest and most economical heaters we tested, the Handy Heater is still an efficient and effective way to add warmth to a chilly space. While many of the models we tested offer at least 1,500 watts of maximum heat, this 1,200-watt personal heater was able to keep pace with them, warming our test room just as quickly as the others. It does not have an internal thermostat, however, so we had to remember to turn it off manually once we were done. It also doesn’t have a remote, which lessens its ease of use a bit as well. But that doesn’t mean this small space heater is short on features—it just means its features are different. The Handy Heater has both a multi-color LED night light and an internal filter for odor and dust removal, two things none of the other models offer. In terms of safety, it has an automatic mechanism that shuts the machine off if it’s knocked over or lifted. The unit is on the loud side, however, registering 67.3 decibels on high. This is about as loud as a normal conversation, which is a bit more than its advertised “whisper quiet” level.

Upgrade Pick Vornado Whole Room Heater With Auto Climate Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4/5; Performance 4.75/5; Portability 5/5; Noise 5/5; Value 4.3/5 Product Specs Type: Fan Fan Maximum heat output: 1,500 watts 1,500 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 256 square feet What We Like Stays completely cool to the touch Underside features an integrated cord wrap area Super quiet, even on high Only weighs 5.56 pounds What We Don’t Like Some of the cost is likely for the Vornado name Must set a thermostat temperature We admit we’re suckers for Vornado products: They offer effective and efficient fans and heaters with great designs and features. So, we weren’t surprised that we loved this whole-room heater with automatic climate control, even if it’s a bit on the spendy side. Despite being only about the size of a basketball, this small heater worked quickly to heat our closed-door 150-square-foot test room. When we tried it in an open-door 240-square-foot room, it also brought the room to temp (from 66 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit) remarkably quickly, in just under two hours. Though we wish you could simply set the heater to high or low heat rather than having to enter a desired thermostat temperature, the Vornado’s remote control and timer make this heater/fan combo super easy to use. Its cord is plenty long at 6 feet, and the unit has an integrated cord wrap station on the underside for tidy storage and portability. It was also one of the quietest models we tested, producing just 35 decibels of sound (equivalent to a whisper) on high during our tests. This go-anywhere heater and fan is ideal for warming toes under a desk or setting up on a side table for a little extra heat or a cool breeze. Get the Vornado electric heater at Amazon, Lowe’s, The Home Depot, or Vornado. Best With Fan Lasko All-Season Hybrid Tower Fan and Space Heater Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 5/5; Performance 4.5/5; Portability 4/5; Noise 5/5; Value 4.3/5 Product Specs Type: Ceramic Ceramic Maximum heat output: 1,500 watts 1,500 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 300 square feet What We Like Good year-round all-in-one heater/fan option Taller height distributes warmth across the body Stays completely cool to the touch during use What We Don’t Like Height makes it a little awkward to carry Slow to heat open spaces For those looking for a year-round supplemental cooling and heating system, this Lakso ceramic space heater and tower fan is an excellent option. Though many electric heaters offer fan-only operation for use any season, we think the height of this model (it’s just over 3 feet tall) makes it better suited for summer than others that sit low to the ground. At first, we actually wanted to ding this model for being so tall since that makes it a bit awkward to move from room to room. But when sitting at our desks or lying in bed, it was nice to have this bedroom space heater‘s heat up high so we could feel it across our entire bodies. This will certainly also be true this August when we’re desperate to feel a cool breeze across our arms and faces. Initially, it appeared that only one length of the fan/heater combo’s substantial height functions at a time. When you turn on the heat, it comes from the left side, and when you turn on the fan, cool air comes from the right. When we ticked down the thermostat from 79 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, however, the heater automatically set its output to low and kicked on the fan, allowing both sides to work toward reaching the new set temperature. Beyond that, the tower fan’s controls are intuitive to use, and the entire appliance stays completely cool to the touch, even on its highest heat setting. In the end, the only real downside to this model is that it took a bit longer than other 1,500-watt heaters we tested to warm up a large open room. What our tester says: “This heater is exactly why we test. It’s a Lasko, so I expected to love it. But then, during testing, I found features I really didn’t like—at first. Then, once I got into using it, everything about the Lasko made sense and made me want to keep it accessible year-round.” —Michelle Larson, Product Reviews tester and writer Get the Lasko electric heater at Walmart or Amazon (white). Best Electric Fireplace Maxhonor Electric Fireplace Heater With Remote Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4.5/5; Performance 4/5; Portability 4/5; Noise 4/5; Value 4.5/5 Product Specs Type: Ceramic Ceramic Maximum heat output: 1,500 watts 1,500 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 400 square feet What We Like Attractive and efficient warming Glass panel stays cool to the touch during use Works via touch screen or included remote What We Don’t Like Complicated to recess while maintaining cord’s outlet access You may be asking yourself if an attractive fireplace heater will be as effective at warming up a room as a more utilitarian-looking option. We had the same question, and our testing revealed the answer: almost! Though this Maxhonor’s 1500-watt output only brought the temperature of our test room up by 5 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 minutes rather than 6, we think sacrificing some of that power to it producing mesmerizing dancing flames rather than heat is worth it. Though we didn’t install this heater into our wall, doing so would add to the fireplace’s ambiance even more. Just remember that you’ll need to plan access for the 6-foot cord to reach an outlet, as extension cords should not be used with space heaters due to increased fire risk. To keep installation a bit easier, you can also surface mount this electric fireplace on the wall, though we tested ours by simply setting it on the floor. No matter where you place it, the blue, green, or red/orange flames it produces look like actual fire, yet its glass screen remains safely cool to the touch. The unit is easy to control via its built-in touch panel or the included remote control. It also has a sleep timer so you can fall asleep watching the fire any time you feel like it.

Best Electric Stove Duraflame 3D Infrared Electric Fireplace Stove Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 5/5; Performance 5/5; Portability 4/5; Noise 5/5; Value 4.7/5 Product Specs Type: Infrared Infrared Maximum heat output: 1,500 watts 1,500 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 1,000 square feet What We Like Infrared quartz heat creates warmth without drying out the air Shuts itself down if it gets too hot Charming design and user-friendly operation Digital display and controls are hidden inside; also works with remote What We Don’t Like Aesthetics bump up the price With its classic design, this Duraflame infrared electric fireplace creates a warm and cozy atmosphere of a real wood-burning stove—minus the mess and smoke. After putting ours through the paces in our test room, we quickly moved it to the basement to enjoy indoor evenings by the fire. It has the same maximum heat output of 1,500 watts as many of the heaters we tested, yet it’s powerful enough to warm spaces up to 1,000 square feet. Even in our relatively large basement, its infrared rays do an excellent job of creating plenty of heat without pulling almost any moisture from the air. We love that the stove’s digital control panel is hidden inside the door and that the fireplace comes with a remote control for easy operation. You can use it to select between five brightness levels, set a timer, or program the thermostat. When we want to watch the fire but don’t need any heat, we simply set the digital thermostat lower than the temperature of the room to enjoy the aesthetics of flames without adding any warmth. We chose this stove in a navy color that complements our space, but you can also get this faux wood burner in black, cinnamon, bronze, cream, or French gray.

Best Wall-Mounted Heat Storm HS-1500-PHX-WIFI Infrared Heater Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4/5; Performance 5/5; Portability 4/5; Noise 4.5/5; Value 4/5 Product Specs Type: Infrared Infrared Maximum heat output: 1,500 watts 1,500 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 150 square feet What We Like The app lets you control heater from your phone Infrared technology heats incredibly quickly Stays cool to the touch, even on the highest setting What We Don’t Like Mounting holes are too close together for studs This wall-mounted Heat Storm heater provides continuous heat for spaces up to 300 square feet without taking up any floor space. Since we knew we wouldn’t need to hardwire it into our electrical system, we expected it to be easy to install—however, we ran into a slight issue. While wall studs are typically 16 inches apart, this unit’s mounting holes are only 13.75 inches apart. That meant we could only insert one screw into a stud, and we had to use a drywall anchor for the other. Since the heater only weighs 9 pounds, it probably would have been okay to mount it directly to the drywall, but we really didn’t want to see it come crashing down. Once we had it mounted, however, this Wi-Fi heater was easy to use via its included remote or the Smart Life app. With the app, we measured the room’s temperature, turned on the eclectic heater, and set its thermostat to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. In just 18 minutes, the temperature in the space increased by 5 degrees, and the heater turned off. Those who’d rather not mount the Heat Storm (and who don’t care about pairing it with their Wi-Fi to operate it via app) might prefer the Heat Storm HS-1500-PHX, which comes with attachable feet for use on the floor. Both versions stay cool to the touch and feature overheating protection should the appliance become too warm during operation.

Best for Garage Comfort Zone Ceiling-Mounted Industrial Heater Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4.5/5; Performance 5/5; Portability n/a; Noise 4/5; Value 4/5 Product Specs Type: Fan Fan Maximum heat output: 5,000 watts 5,000 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 1,000 square feet What We Like Can be hardwired or fit with a cord for a 30-amp outlet Easy to disassemble and clean Straightforward controls for easy temperature adjustments What We Don’t Like Requires purchase of wire and cable clamp Need to be able to reach to change settings The Comfort Zone electric heater is a great option for those looking for semi-permanent installation in a garage wall or ceiling. You can either hardwire it into your home’s electrical system or fit it with a plug-in cord for a 30-amp outlet. During testing, these options initially seemed easy enough, but the process ended up being a bit of a mixed bag, as the heater didn’t come with the 240-volt pigtail or box entry (the cable clamp that secures the wire to the box). Once we made the necessary purchases, however, we found this Comfort Zone appliance to be a quality electric garage heater. Its durable steel body was resistant to impact damage (accidents happen), and its dual-knob thermostat was easy to adjust so we could control the temperature in our garage. Since this heavy-duty forced-air electric shop heater outputs an impressive 5,000 watts, it’s nice it has adjustable louvers and a variable-angle mounting bracket to direct airflow wherever necessary. It also has a built-in sensor that signals it to switch off if the heater’s temperature gets too high. One other plus: Removing the grill is simple, making future cleanings a breeze.

Best in-Wall Broan-NuTone 198 High-Capacity Wall Heater Photo: Amazon See It Our Ratings: Ease of Use 4/5; Performance 5/5; Portability n/a; Noise 4.5/5; Value 4/5 Product Specs Type: Radiant and fan Radiant and fan Maximum heat output: 2,000 to 4,000 watts 2,000 to 4,000 watts Compatible square footage: 265 to 400 square feet What We Like Can be hardwired or plugged into an outlet Doesn’t have to be inserted into the wall; it can also be mounted Fan delay prevents airflow until it’s properly heated What We Don’t Like Requires 240 volts to deliver maximum output If you want your heater off the floor and out of the way, the in-wall electric Broan-NuTone 198 is a great option. You can either insert the entire box into a custom-cut cavity or keep things a bit simpler by mounting it to the wall. In addition to flexibility regarding installation, this high-capacity heater also offers a range of maximum heat outputs. If you want the full 4,000 watts it’s capable of, you’ll need to hardwire it to a 240V electrical system. With a standard 120V outlet, this heater offers half the output at 2,000 watts (still more than most models on our lists). The Boan-NuTone 198 proved itself a heavy-duty competitor in our tests. The forced-fan heater has an 18-gauge steel grill, adjustable thermostat, and downflow louvers that direct airflow toward the ground. For that reason, we opted to install it somewhat high up on our garage wall, though still low enough to easily access the adjustable thermostat on the heater’s face. Since we installed it in a somewhat dirty environment, we appreciate that there’s a delay that prevents the fan from blowing out air until the heating element has reached a high enough temperature and that the faceplate is removable for easy cleaning. Get the Broan-NuTone electric heater at Amazon, The Home Depot, or Wayfair. Another Great Option Best Baseboard Cadet F Series 3-Foot Electric Baseboard Heater Photo: Amazon See It Product Specs Type: Baseboard Baseboard Maximum heat output: 750 watts 750 watts Compatible square footage: Up to 100 square feet What We Like Frame is pre-punched for secure installation 36-inch length will work in most spaces 25-gauge steel won’t scratch or tarnish over time What We Don’t Like Must be hardwired into your electrical system Requires an external thermostat Electric baseboard heaters are a simple and economical way to add quiet and efficient heat without losing an outlet or having to reconfigure your existing ductwork. This option from Cadet is 36 inches long and outputs a maximum of 750 watts, making it ideal for small bedrooms or offices under 100 square feet. Its low-profile design and quiet operation won’t take up unnecessary space or cause distracting noise pollution. Though this electric baseboard heater is rated for a 120-volt connection, you must still have it hardwired into your home’s electrical system. This is made easier by the fact that the heater’s frame is pre-punched, but unless you have extensive DIY experience, the job may be better left to a professional. You’ll also need to purchase a line voltage electronic thermostat, programmable wall thermostat, or built-in thermostat to control it. But once the Cadet baseboard heater is finally up and running, its 25-gauge steel will stand the test of time without showing any nicks or scratches.

How We Chose and Tested the Best Electric Heaters Photo: Michelle Larson for Bob Vila When choosing and testing electric heaters, we started by researching popular options according to type, heat output and coverage, safety aspects, and additional features. After spending two weeks testing nine of our favorites, we rated each model for ease of use, performance, portability, noise, and value. Our hands-on tests looked at assembly and installation, the amount of time required to raise a room’s temperature by 6 degrees Fahrenheit (in both small and large rooms), and the effect on humidity. Where possible, we also evaluated their portability and the efficacy of any additional features. We used decibel readers to measure noise and pushed models over to see if they’d really turn off. We also set up multiple external thermometers to see if the heaters’ internal thermostats were accurate. Our final list of favorites includes ceramic, infrared, or fan/forced-air heat options. Most offer multiple settings, programmable thermostats, and remote controls. According to our test results and your individual needs, it should be relatively easy to find an electric heater that’s right for your room. What to Consider When Choosing an Electric Heater When choosing the best electric heater for the home, the following list of considerations should help you narrow down your search. Types of Electric Heaters Electric heaters are available in multiple styles, including fan, infrared, baseboard, panel, and electric fireplaces. Electric Fan Heaters Electric fan heaters are also called fan-forced heaters because they use an electric heating element to heat the surrounding air rapidly, which is then forced out of the heater by a fan. The fan is located in the back of the heater, which allows it to push the air in a single direction. The heated air gradually warms the ambient temperature of the room. Since this style of electric heater takes time to heat up, these are best used as space heaters in smaller rooms and workspaces where the increase in heat will be more noticeable. Electric fan heaters are one of the more affordable types available. Electric Infrared Heaters Electric infrared heaters also are known as radiant or quartz heaters. They generate radiant infrared heat and can be used for large rooms as well as small spaces. These heaters provide a higher heat intensity when compared to fan-forced electric heaters. However, the heat generated by infrared heaters does not warm the air within the space. Rather, infrared heaters use infrared waves to warm physical objects, like a person or vehicle. This means that while users will feel warm with the heater on, the ambient air will not change temperature. When the heater is switched off, the temperature of the objects and people in the room may drop depending on the temperature in the home. This feature makes electric infrared heaters great garage heaters or enclosed patio heaters, where trying to heat the cold air would be a waste of energy. Electric Baseboard Heaters Electric baseboard heaters are one of the more basic styles of whole-home heating. When installed in a room or living space, these heaters can be adjusted with a temperature dial. They can also be portable, with a stand and a regular power cord. When the element within the baseboard heater is turned on, it heats the air around it. The heated air expands and lifts into the air, moving away from the floor and allowing more cold air to circulate to the exposed elements. While a baseboard heater can be a low-cost electric heating system with regard to the initial purchase price, exclusive use of baseboard heaters can be one of the causes of a high electric bill. Electric Panel Heaters Electrical panel heaters typically use infrared heating technology to provide heat to the people in the room without heating the air within the room. The difference is that these heaters are designed to be completely flat so that users can mount them on the wall like a poster or picture frame. They are also a great option for mounting on the ceiling so that the entire room can increase in warmth without obstacles impeding the flow of infrared heating. If users don’t want to mount the electric panel heater, they can just stand it up on the floor or desk to keep warm throughout the day. Panel heaters come in a range of sizes, so users can customize the heater to the size of the space. Electric Fireplace Heaters This style of indoor electric heater gives users the style of a fireplace and the safety of an electric heater. Electric fireplaces typically have a traditional decorative appearance with a light effect designed to mimic flames flickering in a classic fireplace. These fireplace heaters may use radiant heating or fan-forced heating, although infrared is the most commonly seen style. Electric fireplace heaters are a great option for a den, living room, or dining room, where they can heat the entire space while accenting interior decorating choices. Room Size Before choosing an electric heater, measure the size of the room so you choose a model with enough power for your square footage. Smaller rooms, like bedrooms and home offices, can usually be heated relatively easily with any type of electric heater. A heater for large rooms, like the living room, dining room, kitchen, or basement, will need to be a more powerful heater, such as a baseboard heater, electric fireplace, or fan-forced heater. Power After you determine the size of your room, look at electric heaters that would be suitable for your space. Generally speaking, you can heat 1 square foot of space for every 10 watts of output. This means a 1,000-watt heater should be sufficient for a 100-square-foot room. However, if you’re also heating that room with a furnace, you may be able to get away with an even smaller electric heater. While some electric heaters can run on batteries, a majority will need to be plugged into an outlet. Some high-capacity options may need to be hardwired into your home’s 120-volt electrical system or even require a hardwired 240-volt connection. Heating Features Photo: Michelle Larson for Bob Vila Though some baseboard heaters come without a thermostat, most electric heaters aren’t merely heating elements. Many models have programmable or adjustable thermostats that feature a variety of heat settings and have oscillation control. Programmable thermostats allow users to set a specific temperature for the heater and a heating schedule that responds to increased or decreased needs. allow users to set a specific temperature for the heater and a heating schedule that responds to increased or decreased needs. You can operate adjustable thermostats with the touch of a button or the turn of a dial to adjust the current desired temperature. Unless they are programmable, you’ll have to make those changes manually. with the touch of a button or the turn of a dial to adjust the current desired temperature. Unless they are programmable, you’ll have to make those changes manually. Most electric heaters offer up to four heat settings so that you can adjust output according to the size of the room, the current temperature, or your proximity to the heater. so that you can adjust output according to the size of the room, the current temperature, or your proximity to the heater. Oscillation helps distribute heated air and infrared heating to a much wider area. Different models will have different degrees of oscillation, so be sure to check your product’s specifications when considering a specific heater. helps distribute heated air and infrared heating to a much wider area. Different models will have different degrees of oscillation, so be sure to check your product’s specifications when considering a specific heater. Remote controls make it easier to operate an electric heater without the need to walk over to it. Not only is this convenient, but it can also be an important accessibility factor for a wall- or ceiling-mounted heater. Energy Efficiency One main benefit of adding an electric heater to a home is that users won’t need to turn up the temperature in the entire house just to heat one small space. This lets you relax at your perfect temperature while saving money on the heating bill. However, users also may want to look for a model specifically labeled as an energy-efficient heater to ensure they’re conserving as much energy and hard-earned money as possible. Another way to save energy is to consider the room’s size and the heater’s output to select a product appropriate for the space. Features like a programmable thermostat, energy-saving mode, and a simple timer can also help increase energy efficiency. Safety Features Safety is a factor when using all types of heating systems, and electrical heaters are no exception. For this reason, many heaters have built-in safety features like cool-touch exteriors, tip-over protection, and overheating protection. Users can also look for the UL certification, which indicates a heater has undergone extensive testing to confirm its safety and reliability. Cool-touch exteriors are typically made of fiberglass or plastic that is safe to the touch. Because of this, they are great options for wall-mounted and portable electric heaters because they are often used in locations where passersby may come into contact with them. are typically made of fiberglass or plastic that is safe to the touch. Because of this, they are great options for wall-mounted and portable electric heaters because they are often used in locations where passersby may come into contact with them. Tip-over mechanisms protect heaters from starting fire if they fall over. The impact of being knocked over activates this safety feature, turning off the heater so that it cannot ignite nearby items, such as carpeting or curtains. protect heaters from starting fire if they fall over. The impact of being knocked over activates this safety feature, turning off the heater so that it cannot ignite nearby items, such as carpeting or curtains. Overheating protection keeps the electric heater from burning out if it becomes too hot. This feature senses the heater’s rising temperature and shuts it down to prevent external damage to the room or any flammable objects and internal damage to the heater. Portability Some electric heaters are fixed units that are installed in the ceiling or walls. Semiportable units typically sit in one place but can be moved with some effort, and fully portable heaters are lightweight and may have features that make them easier to move, such as a compact size, wheels, or a built-in handle. Electric heaters can range from industrial units that weigh more than 100 pounds to small desktop heaters that users can hold in one hand. The smaller a heater is, the more portable it tends to be, but larger electric heaters can use a set of wheels to achieve similar portability. These electric heaters may also have a built-in handle that helps lift, support, or pull the heater from place to place. Noise Level The noise level produced by an electric heater isn’t normally any louder than a portable fan or the forced airflow from a furnace. However, if noise is a concern, users should avoid fan-forced electric heaters as the fan they rely on to push heated air out into the room can greatly increase the amount of noise the heater produces. For a more silent operation in the home, use a fireplace heater, an infrared heater, a panel heater, or a baseboard heater, all of which are capable of operating without a fan. FAQs Electric space heaters are suitable for warming a space in winter without adding excess energy costs. In fact, the cost to run a space heater is usually relatively low. Read on to find the answers to some commonly asked questions about these efficient space warmers. Q. What type of electric heater is cheapest to run? The cost of running an electric heater depends on your local electrical costs, the wattage of the electric heater, and how long the heater is used. However, on average, a 1,500-watt electric space heater will cost between 18 cents and 25 cents per hour to use. Q. Do electric heaters need ventilation? Electric heaters don’t need ventilation because they don’t burn fuel, so they don’t give off a combustion byproduct that would require ventilation. Thus, they are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Q. Is it OK to sleep with an electric heater on? It isn’t a good idea to sleep with your electric heater on, even if it has an automatic shutoff function to keep you safe. This is because the heater can significantly dry out the air, causing you to wake up with a dry mouth, a headache, or feeling dehydrated. Also, safety features can sometimes fail, and if you are asleep, you will not be able to deal with or recognize an emergency until it wakes you up. Q. Do electric room heaters reduce oxygen? An electric room heater won’t reduce the oxygen in your home, though extended use could cause the air to become dry, making it feel as though it is more difficult to breathe. Q. Do electric heaters give off carbon monoxide? No, electric heaters don’t give off carbon monoxide (CO). CO is only produced by fuel-burning non-electric heaters and appliances. Q. How many BTUs should an electric heater be? The electric heaters in this guide produce between about 2,550 BTUs and 17,050 BTUs to accommodate rooms ranging from 100 to 1,000 square feet. The BTUs of the electric heater you choose will depend on your room size and heating requirements. Q. Where is the best place to put an electric heater? The best place to put an electric heater will depend on the heater itself and your individual needs. Generally speaking, they’ll need to be within about 6 feet of an electrical outlet (or you’ll need an extension cord) and away from any possible exposure to water. Some users may want to tuck one under their desk to warm their feet, while others may prefer to keep them at a distance to warm the room without feeling the heat on their bodies.

The compact model will be available with front-wheel and all-wheel drive from 2025.,https://www.heise.de/en/news/Electric-car-presentation-Suzuki-e-Vitara-with-all-wheel-drive-on-request-10003487.html,,2024-11-04 19:52:00,heise online,,"Anzeige Suzuki is venturing into the highly competitive electric B-segment with the e-Vitara. The 4.27 m long, 1.63 m high and 1.80 m wide crossover is produced on a new technical basis in India and is available with either a 49 or 61 kWh battery. Its special feature is the option of all-wheel drive with off-road functions. Suzuki's first electric car To date, Suzuki has had only one model that can also cover a significant distance electrically, apart from mild hybrid drives with the plug-in hybrid Across. However, this is a makeshift solution to save fleet consumption, which is only possible thanks to badge engineering with partner Toyota. The Across is actually a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (test) with an electric WLTP range of 75 km. With the e-Vitara, on the other hand, which rolls off the production line at Suzuki's Gujarat plant in India and is due to be launched in Germany next summer, Suzuki is launching its first own electric car. Bild 1 von 8 Suzuki e-Vitara I (8 Bilder) Ganz offensichtlich ist Suzuki daran gelegen, den e-Vitara auch in der Darstellung als geländegängig zu charakterisieren. (Bild: Suzuki ) The e-Vitara is based on the angular appearance that the Suzuki EVX Concept study already hinted at. The interior of the production vehicle is also not quite as futuristic as the concept car. Piano lacquer and leather upholstery cater to more bourgeois tastes and thanks to the wheelbase of at least 2.70 m, there is apparently also sufficient space in the rear. All-wheel drive model with off-road program The instrument and control screens are combined into a single unit, and the driving modes are selected using a rotary knob. Surrounding this button are the buttons for the driving modes, hill start and hill descent assistance and trail mode, a traction assistance program for loose surfaces such as snow or gravel.

(Bild: Suzuki ) Suzuki is introducing its battery-electric ""Heartect-e"" platform with the e-Vitara. The drive is provided by ""electric axles"" (e-axles), each of which combines an electric motor and inverter in one housing. Two lithium iron phosphate batteries with 49 and 61 kWh are available and the cell chemistry alone means that Suzuki will install a battery preconditioning system. The importer does not yet know exactly what this will be able to do, nor does it know the values for charging performance and duration of the two batteries. This is because the homologation process is still underway, as Suzuki Germany said in response to our inquiry. In conjunction with the 49 kWh battery, only a front-wheel drive with 106 kW and a torque of 189 Nm is available. If you choose the 61 kWh battery, you have the choice between front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive ""Allgrip-e"". With front-wheel drive, 128 kW and also 189 Nm are available, while with all-wheel drive there is an additional motor on the rear axle with 48 kW, resulting in a system output of 135 kW and a maximum torque of 300 Nm. With the small battery, the electric car weighs at least 1.7 tons, with the large battery 1.8 and with all-wheel drive 1.9. Soon also as a Toyota The Suzuki e-Vitara competes with the recently redesigned Opel Mokka Electric (from 36,740 euros), the Smart #1 (from 34,990 euros) and the Kia EV3 (from 35,990 euros), among others.

(Image credit: Kia) Inside, there’s a clever use of cloth (made from recycled plastics) that covers most of the dash, while the central extendable wood effect arm rest acts as a place to rest a laptop (so you can work while charging) or a taco tray (so you can eat while charging). There’s plentiful head and legroom for all, the trunk or boot is massive, and there’s extra stowage space in the ‘frunk’. Better still, the seats are beyond comfortable, with adjustable and cushioned headrests pinched from the EV9 that beat most pillows for plushness. Unlike the EV6, which can feel a little gloomy inside, the EV3 is light, airy and welcoming, making it great for those with young kids. It’s easy to swivel around in the front seats and chat to those in back. A full length panoramic sunroof would improve the airiness even further but it’s a nice place to be. Screen time (Image credit: Kia) Kia isn’t shy about the technology it offers as standard on the EV3, with the infotainment system comprising two 12.3-inch displays, as well as a smaller 5.3-inch panel sandwiched in-between the two that takes care of air conditioning. It is all very clever stuff that’s largely very simple to use, while physical buttons remain so the screen-prodding is kept to a minimum. It’s a mammoth digital offering, although the climate control panel is annoyingly located just behind the steering wheel, making it difficult to see and interact with. Spend a bit extra and the cars come with a crisp head-up display, while the constantly-connected nature of the vehicle results in smart mapping and routing, as well as a suite of downloadable apps, such as YouTube. There’s also the full gamut of Hyundai’s latest digital assistant, which uses generative AI to communicate and answer questions in natural language. It can control most of the functionality within the vehicle, but is also open to wider questions and queries. It works well. Even the interior lighting is clever, with the ability to change the hue to suit a mood. During the test drive, I noticed it flashed red when it detected that I was traveling above the speed limit (sorry, officer). (Image credit: Kia) The smart adaptive cruise control is intuitive and very easy to use, even automatically adapting your speed if it detects average speed road sections and it is able to autonomously change lanes with a flick of the indicator stalk. It is all very clever stuff that’s largely very simple to use, while physical buttons remain so the screen-prodding is kept to a minimum. Above all else, the tech (and interior as a whole) feels approachable and not as shouty as other brands. Kia wanted to create a luxury home decor ambience and it has paid off. The front seats even feature a one-button, fully-reclined mode to assist with catching some zeds while charging. You can’t get any more laid back and homely than that. A premium EV experience (Image credit: Kia) The EV3 won’t blow any minds with its driving performance, but that’s not its intention. The 150kW/204hp motor found across the entire range is capable of propelling the car from a standstill to 62mph in 7.5 seconds, which is plenty enough for most, but tame compared to other EVs. Similarly, the steering is light and a breeze to use around town and the driving dynamics lend themselves to daily use, rather than thrill-seeking on country lanes. Perhaps more importantly, the electric range of 372 miles in the larger battery option (267 miles in the 58kWh variant) is decent enough for lengthy road trips. The max charging speed is 128kW for the larger battery, meaning a 20-80 per cent top-up will take around 30 minutes from a fast charger. That's down somewhat on rivals, but still fast enough to make big distances possible. The Hyundai Motor Group in general has some of the most efficient EVs on sale today and the Kia EV3 is no different. The range that’s offered up by the infotainment system is pretty much spot on and the built-in routing will assist by delivering live charging availability and route options that incorporate the required charging stops. (Image credit: Kia) Granted, the EV3 isn’t the ultra-affordable compact car some sectors of the buying public have been demanding, but it isn’t designed to hit that brief. Hyundai has the Inster to fill that void and Kia has promised its smallest most affordable vehicle in the EV2, which is due in 2026. Instead, the EV3 is a great middle-ground, affording plenty of space and tons of tech, while substantially undercutting a Kia EV6 with similar power output and overall range. It’s excellent and Kia has seemingly done it again with another hit EV.

Adding battery power into the company's most popular model, the Macan, feels like a natural progression of the company's EV plans. We've already driven the range-topping Macan Electric Turbo, but now we've also experienced the basic model in the family, the entry-level Macan Electric RWD, testing it out in southern Germany. Happily, the slowest Macan EV stays true to its Porsche roots, even if the powertrain doesn't knock your socks off. Our expert editors test every vehicle we review. Read more about how we test and review cars here. Rocky Photograph The Lowdown The Macan Electric range is building to the point where it will completely replace the previous-generation internal combustion Macan, which is still being sold alongside it. The entry-level, rear-wheel-drive Macan Electric is being added to the lineup for the 2025 model year beneath the 4, 4S and Turbo. While lacking the traction of all-wheel drive, the RWD version offers a more affordable path to Macan Electric ownership — but it is still more than $12,000 pricier than the base ICE version. Vehicle Tested: 2025 Porsche Macan Electric 2025 Porsche Macan Electric Base Price: $77,295 $77,295 Price as tested: $TBA $TBA Location: Stuttgart, Germany More Specs Powertrain: single motor, rear-wheel drive Power: 355 hp Torque: 415 lb-ft 0-60 mph: 5.2 seconds Battery capacity: 95.0 kWh Weight: 5300 pounds EPA range: TBC How Does It Drive? View Full Gallery Rocky Photograph With the introduction of a base model to the Macan Electric lineup, the delta in performance between the bottom end and the top of the line has become staggering. While the rear-driver makes a healthy 355 horsepower, the Turbo makes 576 hp. That said, their range numbers only differ marginally, with the RWD claiming 315 miles and the Turbo 288. All Macan Electric models are powered by the same 100-kWh battery and built on the VW Group's relatively new Premium Electric platform. The result of this shared heritage is that driving differences are felt primarily in the power delivery. The base Macan Electric definitely feels like a poor relation compared to its more potent siblings, despite its headline power figure and ability to deliver 415 lb-ft of peak torque. The RWD lacks the ability to push its driver forcefully back into the seat during a hard launch, a sensation you might reasonably expect any electric Porsche to deliver. This could partially be due to a taller ratio for its single-speed transmission versus the rest of the range, one that improves efficiency but also contributes to an official 5.4-second 0-to-60-mph time. That just isn't quick by modern EV standards. Despite that, Porsche deserves praise for the linearity of its accelerator response, feeding power to the rear wheels in seemingly perfect correlation to the pedal position — an attribute that definitely isn't shared with all electric competitors. It'll chirp its rear tires under hard acceleration from standstill but only with the traction control turned off. View Full Gallery Rocky Photograph The Macan EV might be the slowest of the company's electric cars, but its Porsche-born attributes are readily apparent. The steering is well-weighted for every speed, surface, and drive mode. Turn-in is rapid, and the responses linear. Even on a derestricted section of German autobahn, the front end felt unaffected by lift as speeds rose well beyond what would have been legal in the U.S. With a drag coefficient of 0.25 and self-leveling active air suspension (standard on all Macan Electric variants in the States), the RWD Macan felt entirely comfortable doing big velocities. The addition of rear-wheel steering on my test car (set to be a $2030 option) enhanced agility even further, both in low-speed maneuvering and in tight corners. The braking system works well at combining regeneration and friction seamlessly. Porsche doesn't offer a one-pedal drive mode, nor does it allow much adjustment of regeneration levels, but the company's engineers have done a fine job in making it feel natural. The brakes in my test car possessed the linear pedal feel and forceful bite that Porsche is known for. What's It Like To Live With? STUDIO GOICO The Macan Electric's cabin feels like a substantial upgrade over that of its gasoline-powered sibling, which is no surprise, given the ICE version is a heavy facelift of a car that was launched a decade ago. The new car has more technology and an improved sense of solidity, which is apparent even when doing something as simple as operating a window switch. The Macan RWD might be the entry-level model, but buyers still have myriad choices when it comes to trim colors and extra equipment — although indulging in many of them will quickly move the RWD well beyond the base price of its quicker siblings. Even if you don't tick a single box, it's a classy, well-finished place to be. Two screens come as standard: a 12.6-inch digital gauge cluster and a 10.9-inch infotainment touchscreen in the center of the dashboard. It's also possible to add another 10.9-inch screen as a display for the front passenger (a $1570 option) and an augmented-reality head-up display for an extra $2530. The user interface features swift responses, crisp graphics, and intuitive menu construction, but I loved the passenger's screen's ability to control music and navigation, transferring such duties to the non-driving partner. Climate control is managed by a panel that combines a digital display with analog control switches, the best of both worlds in terms of usability. And you've got to love an EV that still gives features a volume knob rather than just a touch-sensitive panel. My only real complaint was with the more intrusive elements of the ADAS assistance systems on my Euro-spec test car, with an incessant alert whenever a speed limit was broken — and this reset every time the car was turned on. Steering intervention for the lane-keeping function felt abrupt as well. Fingers crossed that U.S.-spec cars will be spared quite so much nannying. Finally, I found the seats in the Macan Electric to be agreeable but not particularly comfortable over longer periods of driving, though the adjustable bolstering was welcomed. Should I Buy One? View Full Gallery Rocky Photograph Even the most basic Macan Electric feels like a true Porsche, from its dynamic responses to the tightness of its fit and finish. But although this 5000-pound crossover is impressively nimble for what it is, it also lacks the engagement that comes as standard with the gasoline Macan in terms of noise — or even the simple pleasure of paddle-shifting a PDK transmission. The RWD version significantly broadens the appeal of the Macan Electric range, being priced close enough to rivals to trigger defections for those who are willing to sacrifice performance (and driven-wheel count) for a Porsche badge and driving experience. It's not the most exciting Macan Electric, but the rear-wheel-drive version is likely the easiest for potential buyers to justify. Highlights and Lowlights We Love: The quick, well-weighted steering system, no matter if rear-wheel steering is fitted. Modern, well-designed infotainment system paired with a passenger's screen. The ability to match seat belts to paint color, for a price. We Don't Love: It's slow for a top-end EV The silent powertrain lacks the character of its combustion sister Way too much ADAS intervention (on the European version) Favorite Detail: My initial queasy impressions of Porsche's augmented-reality display were based on an uneasy disconnect between my eyes and brain, but reading the moving, active heads-up display became routine after half an hour or so. The distance-centered directions were particularly helpful while driving in an unfamiliar country.

What Would Elon Musk’s Tesla Gain—and Lose—From a Trump Presidency?,This issue is preventing our website from loading properly.

Your guide to the most important world stories of ...,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/31/elon-musk-trump-tesla-electric-vehicles-mandate/,,2024-10-31 06:00:00,Foreign Policy,,"Since Musk’s endorsement, Trump has softened his tone, stating, “ I’m for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly .” In the past, Trump has been openly opposed to EVs and federal support for the industry and incentives, saying he would roll back supportive policies such as the tax credit program for EV purchases of up to $7,500 for new cars. That program has been in place since 2008 as part of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act under President George W. Bush; the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 modified and extended this credit. When Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, endorsed former President Donald Trump, financially supported his reelection campaign, and even attended rallies in swing states, he upended a lot of the politics around electric vehicles (EVs). It used to be quite an easy distinction to make: Climate-conscious Democrats would buy EVs and Democratic Party policies supported EV uptake, while Republicans were against EVs. (As recently as 2023, a Gallup poll found that about 71 percent of Republicans would not consider buying an EV , compared with 17 percent of Democrats.) However, the political landscape and rhetoric around EVs is beginning to shift.

That program has been in place since 2008 as part of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act under President George W. Bush; the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 modified and extended this credit. Musk has repeatedly stated he is anti-subsidies, though Tesla has received $2.8 billion in state and federal government subsidies in the form of grants and tax credits since it delivered its first car in 2008. Tesla also earned nearly $9 billion from carbon credit sales since 2009, trading these regulatory credits to other automakers that need to comply with emissions standards set by regulators. Despite its strong position as the American EV industry leader—Tesla’s U.S. market share in the third quarter of 2024 was 48 percent, followed by General Motors with 9.3 percent and Ford with 8.6 percent—removing federal incentives for EVs would still impact Tesla’s sales, especially among price-sensitive consumers. EV adoption will remain reliant on subsidies to bridge the cost gap with conventional vehicles. In fact, there is direct evidence from Europe that removing the incentives for consumers too early, before the market is developed, will result in a drop in EV purchases. Because of federal budget constraints, Germany cut the national EV subsidy in December 2023, and sales numbers keep dropping: by 37 percent in July 2024 and 69 percent in August. Most other U.S. manufacturers, such as Ford, GM, and Rivian (which received an investment of up to $5 billion from German carmaker Volkswagen), would likely face significantly tougher challenges in maintaining their EV offerings without such incentives. But even industry leader Tesla would not be immune to these policy changes. If you were looking to crush Tesla’s competition through federal action, first on the chopping block would be policies put in place by the Biden administration to support established automotive component manufacturers to shift to EVs. During a visit to Detroit in May 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris announced an investment for a $100 million fund for small- and medium-size component manufacturers to upgrade facilities that can then produce components needed for EVs. (Most of the smaller suppliers only have production facilities for internal combustion engine vehicles.) More importantly, there is a new $2 billion Domestic Automotive Manufacturing Conversion Grants program from the U.S. Department of Energy for domestic automotive manufacturing in areas such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other swing states. This will be at risk of shutting down if those factories cannot make that transition to EV manufacturing. The fund is meant to support those small manufacturers and their workers and will run from this year through September 2031. Trump has vowed on day one to remove the so-called EV mandate, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean car emissions standards and the Biden administration’s goal that half of new car sales be electric by 2030. While these measures are not legally binding, removing emissions standards would have negative effects on EV development, because investment uncertainty would result, EV production by established automakers would slow down, and consumers would receive the signal to keep buying gas cars. If Trump gets reelected, he has agreed to let Musk take on a government advisory role. When he unveiled his economic plans in September, Trump also announced the creation of a government efficiency commission that Musk would head. This equates to many potential conflicts of interest as Musk’s companies—Tesla, and also and SpaceX—are involved in at least 20 recent investigations or reviews from various U.S. government departments and various U.S. agencies, including the departments of transportation, justice, labor, and interior. Apart from issues that would potentially distort domestic competition, the other factor at play is the competition from Chinese EV makers such as BYD, which already outsold Tesla in the final quarter of 2023, 526,000 to 484,000. There is a 100 percent tariff on Chinese EVs coming into the United States, introduced by the Biden administration in May 2024, and Trump would no doubt keep up these tariffs to keep BYD out of the U.S. market. There is a good chance Trump will even increase them, as there is a bipartisan agreement that domestic industries and the U.S. battery industry need to be protected. By contrast, Musk criticized the tariffs on Chinese EVs (“I’m in favor of no tariffs,” he said at a conference) when they were introduced, advocating instead for free markets with minimal government interference. Both Democrats’ and Republicans’ China policy would keep out Chinese EV manufacturing from the United States. This is in contrast to what is happening in Europe—where BYD is building a production plant in Hungary to avoid European Union tariffs. China would probably retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on imports, and China is Tesla’s second-largest market. As Beijing fosters and grows its own EV industry, Tesla could face barriers to expanding there if United States-China relations worsen, potentially losing even more ground to Chinese EV companies such as BYD or Xiaomi. A return to aggressive tariffs on Chinese goods under a Trump administration could impede not only sales but also Tesla’s supply chain, as many of its components and raw materials such as batteries are sourced or refined in China. Nearly 40 percent of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla’s batteries are Chinese companies. Higher tariffs on battery components from China would force Tesla to pass on costs to consumers or cut into profit margins. EU countries are already preparing for a high-stakes trade war with Trump if he wins a second term. The EU is likely to respond strongly to Trump’s announcement of a universal 20 percent tariff, as such tariffs would hurt some of Europe’s largest companies, including carmakers. Trump already threated to impose tariffs on EU auto exports during his first presidency. In retaliation, the EU would impose tariffs on American goods, potentially targeting key U.S. industries or sectors including companies that are gaining ground in Europe’s EV market, such as Tesla. If the EU enacted counter-tariffs on United States-based automakers, Tesla could face increased costs or restrictions when selling vehicles in the EU. Retaliatory tariffs could complicate Tesla’s European supply chain, increasing production costs or delaying expansions in key markets, including the expansion of Tesla’s Gigafactory in Germany. In a scenario where the EU shifts incentives to favor local manufacturers, Tesla’s European growth strategy could be directly affected, posing challenges to its long-term market positioning. For these reasons, a Trump presidency might not be a slam dunk for Tesla. Two of Musk’s other businesses, SpaceX and Starlink, maintain critical government partnerships, with SpaceX, in particular, becoming integral to U.S. national security and space exploration. But while the impact of a second Trump term on these critical technologies is unclear, it would almost certainly weaken federal support for EVs, potentially slowing market growth and infrastructure expansion critical for their rapid uptake—all of which is urgently needed to reduce transport emissions and mitigate climate change.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article primarily focuses on the potential impacts of a Trump presidency on Tesla and the broader EV market, framed within the political landscape.

How to charge your new electric car at home — and how much you might pay,"Filling up a car with gas is second nature for nearly anyone with a driver's license. But charging an electric vehicle?

Going electric introduces a whole new ...",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-set-up-home-charging-electric-car-ev,,2024-10-30 19:42:00,Business Insider,,"Advertisement To get the most out of your electric car, you'll want to charge it at home, and likely overnight. Home charging can take only a few hours and is healthier for your battery than fast charging. This article is part of ""Getting Ready for Electric,"" a series of guides and practical advice for buying your next EV. Filling up a car with gas is second nature for nearly anyone with a driver's license. But charging an electric vehicle? For many, that's a brand-new world. Going electric introduces a whole new element of car ownership: charging. We spoke with experts at the automotive marketplace Cars.com and the charger installer Qmerit to demystify the process and learn best practices. Advertisement What are the benefits of charging at home? If you have a fast-charging station nearby or a plug available at your workplace, you may be able to get by without charging at home. But Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com and an EV owner herself, argued that charging at home makes EV ownership convenient and worthwhile. ""Home charging is what makes it easy and efficient to own an EV,"" Newman said. ""That's the bottom line."" With the right kind of at-home charger, owners can recharge their cars in a matter of hours. They can plug them in overnight, for example, and wake up with 250 or 300 miles of driving range. This slower charging is also healthier for your car's battery over the long term — and depending on your utility rates, it could be much cheaper. Advertisement EnergySage estimates that charging an EV costs about $0.05 per mile of range added, though that depends on things like location, electricity rates, and the type of EV charger used. DC fast chargers, like Superchargers, can cost up to $0.60 per kWh, depending on congestion. At home, kWh prices tend to be much lower, depending on your local utility and how it sources energy production. How do I get set up to charge at home? Most electric cars come with a Level 1 charging cord. This cord plugs into a standard 110-volt alternating-current household outlet and slowly adds a few miles of driving range an hour. But Newman said sluggish charging speeds may be tough to live with on a daily basis, even if you can plug in for a full night. EV owners and experts recommend charging your EV at home for convenience and savings. UCG Level 2 charging, which she recommends, uses a higher-voltage connection to add more range per hour. These plugs can be found at public charging stations, and homeowners can install them in a garage or driveway. Some EVs also come with these chargers in addition to a Level 1 plug. Advertisement Level 2 chargers can be plugged into a 240-volt socket — like what you may use for an appliance like a dryer — or hardwired into a home's electrical panel. Either way, Newman recommends consulting an electrician who specializes in charger installations to get a handle on the expected costs and work involved. How much does it cost to set up my home for charging? The cost of a home-charging setup varies widely. If you already have a 240-volt outlet in a convenient spot, you may be able to simply buy a charger and plug it in. Level 2 chargers can cost $250 to $750. Otherwise, you could need more extensive — and expensive — work. Ken Sapp, a senior vice president at Qmerit, said most of its jobs cost $1,600 or less, including permits but excluding the cost of the charger itself. Sapp added that projects involve tapping into an existing 240-volt circuit (or adding one) and installing the charger or a dedicated outlet in a convenient location, like the wall of a garage. Advertisement The farther your electrical panel is from where you'd like to plug in, the pricier installation will be, Sapp said. (Ideally your panel is on the same wall as your charger, but if wiring needs to be routed up from a basement, for example, things get trickier.) Moreover, Sapp said, some homes may need to upgrade their electrical panel to handle the extra load from charging, which could increase costs by thousands of dollars. A Level 2 home charger can charge an EV in a matter of hours. ChargePoint When Cars.com installed home chargers for six of its car reviewers in 2022, the costs varied widely. One installation totaled about $1,700. Another required a service upgrade and trenching to route a circuit across a yard to a detached garage, costing nearly $7,000. To make everything a bit easier on your wallet, you can take advantage of a federal tax credit that covers 30% of charger-installation costs up to $1,000. Utilities commonly offer rebates or special electricity rates for EV owners, too. Advertisement When it comes to choosing a charger, Sapp says it's a ""safe bet"" to go with a model recommended by your car's manufacturer. Newman says the right charger depends on what your home can handle and what's best for your specific vehicle. An experienced electrician can help make that decision. ""We don't have to be experts in everything,"" she said. ""It's OK to rely on a knowledgeable electrician to help you navigate this side of things.""",Uncategorized,bing,"The article offers a practical guide on home charging options for electric vehicle (EV) owners, focusing on the steps and costs involved in setting up a home charging system.

(WIS) - Two brand-new vehicles are set to make electric vehicles more accessible in South Carolina. On Thursday, Scout Motors unveiled the Terra and the Traveler. The SUV and truck are fully electric vehicles with a projected 350-mile range. In one of the state’s largest economic developments, the vehicles will be produced at the upcoming production facility in Blythewood, SC. Scout Motors is projecting to roll out its first vehicles by the end of 2026. Scout Motors, which broke ground at its new production center back in February, received a $1.3 billion incentive package from Gov. Henry McMaster. The automotive company said the $2 billion facility will span 1,100 acres and deliver 4,000 jobs to the surrounding area. “It’s an exciting day for South Carolina and I know there will be more and more, but the excitement that is here today on this mountaintop is going to be hard to beat,” said Governor McMaster. McMaster continued, “We’re proud that these auto manufacturers and others want to be in South Carolina. This is one more, this is a great one, and we are delighted to be here. You can just feel the excitement in this place.” McMaster joined Scout enthusiasts, executives, and employees for Thursday’s reveal in Franklin, Tennessee. Scout Motors unveils vehicles set for production at upcoming Blythewood facility - 7 p.m. President and CEO of Scout Motors, Scott Keogh, said the plant will be able to produce 40 cars an hour once it’s operational. The Terra features a 5.5-foot bed, a large center display, front storage, and accelerates from 0-60pmh in 3.5 seconds. From interior to exterior, the vehicle pays homage to the very first Scout vehicle in the 1960s. The Traveler, Scouts' newest SUV model will feature a similar body type to historic Scout SUVs. It will have similar interior features to that of the Terra but with a glass roof and a split tailgate. Chief design officer Chris Benjamin says Scout is confident the new lineup will meet the needs of hardworking South Carolinians. “People take pride in what they’re involved in,” Benjamin said. “So if you have people in South Carolina working in the plant and building these vehicles, they’re drawn to it. It is going to be a special one.” “Economic development, if you have an automotive company, is just great,” said Joern Petri, vice president of Plant Launch. “You have suppliers that are coming in, the qualified labor, 4,000 jobs, 4,000 families...” “Everyone needs a haircut, everyone needs to buy groceries, so it’s not just the factory or company that is benefiting; it’s the community that’s benefiting from an automotive factory.” The construction of the Blythewood plant is on schedule, with nearly 78 percent of the assembly building foundation completed and 57 percent of the steel installed. Petri says Scout is already in conversation with K12 schools across Richland County, SC Ready, and Midlands Tech; with hopes to train, qualify, and then employ. He also says this is a chance for South Carolina to see what the future holds, not only for electric vehicles but as the state transitions into a leading role for vehicle manufacturing.

The new levy concerns European car makers too. ADVERTISEMENT New EU tariffs apply on electric vehicles imported from China as of Wednesday. They remain in place for the next five years. However, negotiations are expected to continue between the EU and China, and the EU could lift the duties if an agreement is reached. Related EU gives final green light to steep tariffs on Chinese electric cars EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. Here are some basic facts about the EU's customs duties: What did the European Union do? The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that enables them to undercut rivals in the EU on price, take a large market share and threaten European jobs. The duties differ depending on the maker: 17% for BYD, 18.8% for Geely and 35.3% for state-owned SAIC. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to a 20.7% duty. The Commission has an individually calculated rate for Tesla of 7.8%. ""By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,"" European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said. Why did the commission take action? Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the Commission has said. The Commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production. Subsidised solar panels from China have wiped out European producers - an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their car industry. Unusually, the Commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European car industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have opposed the tariffs. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas. How is China reacting? Beijing has been sharply critical of the investigation and the higher duties, describing them as protectionist and unfair. The Commerce Ministry has also launched anti-dumping investigations into European exports of brandy, pork and dairy products. Earlier this month, it announced provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on French and other European brandies, after EU member countries voted in favour of finalising the tariffs on EVs. Officials have also said that they are deliberating whether to raise tariffs on imports of petrol-powered vehicles with large engines. ADVERTISEMENT Talks between the two sides have focused in recent weeks on so-called ""price commitments"" as a possible resolution. In such a scenario, car makers would agree to a minimum selling price for their EVs in Europe. Some Chinese automakers are looking at making cars in Europe to avoid any tariffs and be closer to the market. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region. How do the EU tariffs compare to the ones announced by the US? The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the US tariffs will block virtually all Chinese EV imports. That is not what Europe wants to do. ADVERTISEMENT EU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 - but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition The planned tariffs are aimed at levelling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese car makers. European countries subsidise electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all car makers or distort the market in favour of one side. What does this mean for European drivers and carmakers? It's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese car makers are able to make cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising prices. ADVERTISEMENT Currently, Chinese car makers often sell their vehicles overseas at much higher prices than in China, meaning they are favouring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even with a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations cited by AP. BYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of €21,769 ($23,370) in China but €41,990 ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for around $10,000 in China. While consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices later on, the Commission argues.",Business,bing,"The article provides detailed insights into the EU's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, highlighting key aspects of the trade dispute between the EU and China regarding electric vehicles.

These two-wheelers have become a staple for young commuters —especially students—who enjoy the freedom of faster, license-free transportation that blends convenience with speed. Seizing this trend, major motorbike makers like Honda and Yamaha have introduced electric models to meet the evolving needs of the market, breathing new life into Vietnam’s saturated motorcycle scene.In 2023, car sales in Vietnam exceeded 278,000, though only around 15,700 of these were electric. Yet, the outlook for electric four-wheelers is bright. With gas prices climbing and environmental awareness on the rise, EVs offer a sustainable alternative. To accelerate the transition, the Vietnamese government has rolled out incentives ranging from lower import taxes to waived registration fees, making EVs an even more attractive option. Experts forecast that by 2028, one million electric cars will be on Vietnam's roads, with projections reaching 3.5 million by 2040.VinFast has quickly risen as Vietnam’s first electric automaker, symbolizing the rise of electromobility and the ambitions of a homegrown brand with global reach. Having captured Vietnam’s EV market , VinFast looked beyond borders, shipping its first electric cars to the U.S. in early 2023—a bold step into one of the world’s largest automotive arenas. By August 2023, VinFast went public on NASDAQ, with shares briefly peaking at 37.06 U.S. dollars, giving it a valuation over $85 billion—surpassing legacy brands like Ford and General Motors. Strengthening its U.S. presence, VinFast also began building a North Carolina plant with a 150,000-car annual production target.But this ambitious expansion has faced obstacles. In 2024, VinFast scaled back its delivery goal from 100,000 to 80,000 units after reporting mid-year sales of only 21,000 electric cars —largely to GSM, a Vietnamese taxi company owned by VinFast’s parent. The North Carolina plant’s completion was also pushed from 2025 to 2028.

Here’s how it plans to do it. For years, Tesla has been guiding a roughly 50% growth rate in EV deliveries leading to 20 million cars per year in 2030. That growth crashed this year, and Tesla is now expected to be roughly flat in terms of car deliveries in 2024 compared to last year. Interestingly, the pause in growth has encouraged Tesla to share some more precise growth guidance for the first time in a while. Tesla has shared that it plans to grow deliveries between 20 and 30% in 2025. If Tesla can deliver a record number of 515,000 vehicles in Q4, as guided, it will deliver about 1,850,000 in 2024. It means that Tesla expects to deliver between 2.2 and 2.4 million electric vehicles in 2025. How does Tesla deliver this extra ~500,000 EVs Tesla has grown at a 30% rate in the past, but it has never done it when it was producing vehicles at such a high rate. It’s going to be a difficult task, but Tesla has a plan to make it happen. After a full year of production in 2024, Cybertruck is expected to contribute more in 2025. Tesla currently lists a production capacity about 125,000 units. That’s likely more than twice as many Cybertrucks as Tesla is expected to deliver this year. It remains to be seen if Tesla can find the demand for it, but the Cybertruck’s production ramp should contribute to Tesla’s growth in 2025 – although it will be far from enough to reach the goal. The real contributors are expected to be two new vehicles that Tesla is planning to launch in the first half of 2025. Earlier this year, we reported that Elon Musk had canceled plans for new, cheaper Tesla vehicles built on the new ‘unboxed’ platform, often referred to as “the $25,000 Tesla.” He has instead pushed for two new vehicle programs that incorporate some of the features of the new platform, but they are still primarily based on the Model 3/Y platform – so much so that they will be built on the same production lines. These currently unnamed new vehicles are expected to be cheaper than Model 3/Y, which currently start at $43,000 before incentives – likely closer to $30.000-$35,000. Those vehicles are expected to contribute more to Tesla’s growth, but since they will only launch in the first half of 2025, the contribution will be somewhat limited in 2025 as Tesla ramps up production. When discussing the growth guidance, Musk mentioned the “lower-cost vehicles” as contributing to the growth, but he also said that “the advent of autonomy” would contribute: We can’t overcome massive force majeure events, but I think with our lower-cost vehicles with the advent of autonomy, something like a 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess. It sounds like he means that the improvements in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving will help Tesla sell more vehicles. We previously reported on Musk explaining Tesla’s plan to roll out its unsupervised self-driving next year. Finally, Tesla is also planning to do a Model Y refresh early in 2025. That’s important because it is Tesla’s best-selling car by a wide margin. It should be a good thing for demand in 2025, but the switch over to the new design is going to affect production, which makes it a bit of a tossup to contribute to growth in 2025. Electrek’s Take I have already extensively shared my doubts about Tesla’s capacity to release unsupervised self-driving this year, so I don’t think it’s worth going too much into. FSD will likely improve next year and it could convince some people to buy Tesla vehicles, but I doubt it will be a significant factor. The new cheaper models are where the real opportunity is at, but like I said, it will depend on the production ramp. I think it’s also important to think about cannibalization. Many people think that because the new vehicles will be produced on the same production lines as Model 3 and Model Y they will look very similar, but that’s not necessarily the case. Tesla produces Model S and X on the same line, and they are fairly different. But even if they are fairly different, they will likely steal some sales from Tesla’s lower-end vehicles. I think Tesla can achieve that growth next year, but it won’t be easy.",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article provides a detailed insight into Tesla's projected growth in terms of electric vehicle deliveries.

ADVERTISEMENT The European Commission has given the final green light to steep tariffs on electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, officially closing the probe that began one year ago. The tariffs will apply as of Wednesday and remain in place for the next five years. In the meantime, Brussels will continue negotiations with Beijing in an attempt to secure a deal on minimum prices that can replace the tariffs. However, this solution, advocated by Germany, is highly complex and would be difficult to implement on the ground. ""By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,"" said Valdis Dombrovskis, the Commission's executive vice president in charge of trade. The entry into force was widely expected after the inconclusive vote earlier this month where member states failed to mount the necessary majority in favour or against the measures. The Commission invoked its trade powers to break the impasse and approve the duties, which come on top of the existing 10% rate and vary according to brand, as below. Tesla: 7.8% BYD: 17% Geely: 18.8% SAIC: 35.3% Other EV producers in China who cooperated in the investigation but have not been individually sampled: 20.7% Other EV producers in China who did not cooperate: 35.3% The executive argues that additional tariffs are necessary to offset the effects of the subsidies it claims Beijing is injecting on a large scale across its domestic EV sector. The generous financial aid has allowed Chinese producers to sell their cars at artificially lower prices compared to their European competitors, the Commission attests. As a result, Chinese firms' EV sales in Europe have increased at extraordinary pace: their market share jumped from 1.9% in 2020 to 14.1% in the second quarter of 2024, according to the Commission's estimations. Brussels has repeatedly warned that, without taking forceful action, EU carmakers would suffer unsustainable losses and be pushed out of the lucrative market of net-zero mobility, leading to the closure of plants and the dismissal of thousands of workers. The bloc's automotive industry is already in turmoil due to high energy prices, sluggish consumer demand and intense global competition. ""There's a clear and imminent threat to our car industry not making the transition to electric vehicles and being therefore wiped out,"" a senior EU official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Despite the introduction of tariffs, Brussels claims it remains committed to finding a solution with Beijing enforceable by customs duties and compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, something that has so far proven elusive. China denounced the Commission's probe from the outset as a ""naked protectionist act"" consistently denying the existence of subsidies, describing the findings ""artificially constructed and exaggerated,"" and threatening retaliatory measures against the EU's dairy, brandy and pork industries, setting alarm bells ringing in some capitals. ""We disagreed on each and every fact that we established in the investigation,"" the senior EU official said. ""It was a broad disagreement.""

The EU on Tuesday decided to slap hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars after an anti-subsidy probe concluded Beijing's support undercut European automakers. The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears of provoking China's ire and setting off a bitter trade war. Beijing previously denounced the European Union's ""unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable protectionist practices"" during the probe. ""By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,"" EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement. ""We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field,"" he said. China slammed Brussels's decision on Wednesday morning, saying it did not ""agree with or accept"" the tariffs and had filed a complaint under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism. ""China will... take all necessary measures to firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" Beijing's commerce ministry said. The duties will come on top of the current 10 percent on imports of electric vehicles from China. The decision will become law after publication in the EU's official journal, which is expected later on Tuesday or Wednesday, and enter into force no later than Thursday, an EU official said. Brussels' probe found that China's state subsidies were unfairly undercutting European automakers. Once they come into effect, the tariffs will be definitive and last for five years. The extra duties also apply, at various rates, to vehicles made in China by foreign groups such as Tesla -- which faces a tariff of 7.8 percent. Chinese car giant Geely -- one of the country's largest sellers of EVs -- faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent. Ailing companies The tariffs do not have the support of the majority of the EU's 27 member states but in a vote early this month, the opposition was not enough to block them - which would have required at least 15 states representing 65 percent of the bloc's population. The EU launched the probe in a bid to protect its automobile industry, a major industrial player that provides jobs to around 14 million people. France, which pushed for the investigation, welcomed the decision. ""The European Union is taking a crucial decision to protect and defend our trade interests, at a time when our car industry needs our support more than ever,"" French Finance Antoine Armand said in a statement. But Europe's bigger carmakers, including German auto titan Volkswagen, have criticised the EU's approach and have urged Brussels to resolve the issue through talks. The extra tariffs are ""a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe,"" the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said on Tuesday after the announcement. Volkswagen, which has been hit hard by rising competition in China, has previously said the tariffs would not improve the competitiveness of the European automotive industry. That warning came weeks before the ailing giant announced plans on Monday to close at least three factories in Germany and cull tens of thousands of jobs. On Tuesday, Audi, a subsidiary of crisis-hit Volkswagen, announced its intention to stop production of electric vehicles at an embattled factory in Brussels at the end of February next year. Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to gaps and differences. ""We remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and WTO-compatible,"" Dombrovskis said, referring to the World Trade Organization. Retaliatory moves The EU now faces China's retaliation. China already said on October 8 it would impose provisional tariffs on brandy imported from the EU. Beijing has also launched probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products imported into China. Trade tensions between China and the EU are not limited to electric cars, with Brussels also investigating Chinese subsidies for solar panels and wind turbines.

"Scout Motors Debuts All-Electric 2027 Traveler SUV, Terra Pickup","This extended range electric vehicle (EREV) configuration adds a gasoline-powered range extender/generator to the mix, allowing drivers to continue adventuring far off the electric grid.",https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/scout-motors-debut-all-electric-2026-traveler-suv-and-terra-pickup/,,2024-10-29 19:38:00,CNET,,"Scout Motors -- a new electric manufacturer with an old and storied name -- announced two new retro-styled and off-road capable EVs this week at an event outside of Nashville, Tennessee. Meet the Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra pickup, slated to begin deliveries in 2027. The rugged EVs combine trail-ready features like solid axles and locking differentials with future-ready tech, including bidirectional power delivery and the NACS charging standard. And if the looks alone weren't retro enough, there's a version that runs partially on gas. The VW Group launched the Scout Motors brand in 2022 after acquiring the trademark as part of its purchase of American truck manufacturer International Motors (previously Navistar International and, before that, International Harvester). The new rugged EV brand takes its name from the International Scout, a 4x4 off-road vehicle built in Fort Wayne, Indiana, during the 1960s and ’70s -- before the term “SUV” even existed. The startup, as CEO Scott Keogh calls it, is now headquartered in Virginia, operating independently of Volkswagen of America. Its mission is to manufacture exclusively off-road-capable electric trucks and SUVs, with a focus on the US market. (Keogh's last gig was as CEO of VW USA, where he helped launch the ID 4.) The Scout Traveler has a short wheelbase and even shorter overhangs, an ideal combination for highly technical off-roading. Scout Motors Let's first take a look at the Scout Traveler, a retro-styled SUV with a boxy, squared-off aesthetic. The two-tone, white-roof design pays generous homage to the classic Scout 800 and Scout II, but the super-short front overhang, upright proportions and broad-shouldered stance also bring to mind Ford’s recently revived Bronco. The Traveler's fascia is defined by a dark rectangular ""mask"" that integrates the SUV's square, quad-beam LED headlamps and grille. A similar mask element can be found at the rear end, only here the rear-mounted spare tire carrier is integrated into the design for a cohesive look. Swing the spare out of the way and the rear cargo space opens with a split tailgate. Up front, the hood and grille lift to reveal even more storage in the large ""frunk,"" similar to that of Ford's F-150 Lightning. The Terra is about 10 inches longer from bumper-to-bumper than the Rivian R1T and around 2 inches shy of Ford's F-150 Lightning. Scout Motors Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the SUV is the Scout Terra, a dual-cab midsize electric pickup truck that looks and feels like a shot aimed squarely over the bow of the Rivian R1T. The design carries over many of the same cues as the Traveler, but it has a three-box truck silhouette, a tougher-looking hood and a distinct bumper treatment. The pickup is also longer than the SUV (229.2 inches vs. 207.9 inches) with a longer wheelbase (148.6 inches vs. 120.4 inches). Without a spare tire hanging off the back, the “ghost light” taillights and Scout script badge stand out more, punctuating the 5.5-foot bed of the pickup. (That's a foot longer than the R1T for those measuring.) Look closely and you may also spy the Scout 80-inspired flick in the sheet metal crease where the bed meets the cab. These are modern EVs, so there's no escaping the inevitable massive touchscreen dominating their dashboards. However, chief designer Chris Benjamin tells us that physical controls are a big part of the brand's identity and interior design DNA. Big, beefy buttons and knobs can be found on the dashboard and steering wheel, giving passengers tactile control over the tech and climate systems. I especially dig the volume knob tucked into the edge of the screen, resembling a wristwatch crown for easy access by front-seat passengers. Though both EVs feature large screens, the Scouts' dashboards are also home to a plethora of big and beefy physical buttons and knobs. Scout Motors The dashboard behind the screen has a halo of accent lighting that echoes the exterior ghost lights at night and integrates a subtle lip that passengers can stand an iPad on. Scout’s large center console provides plenty of storage, but both the Traveler and Terra models can be optioned without it, offering a front bench seat instead -- probably my favorite bit of throwback flair. Scout's new EVs are built on a unique body-on-frame platform that's completely different from the MEB platform used by other VW Group EVs. Specifically designed for maximum off-road capability, the trucks each boast a solid rear axle, a disconnecting front sway bar for maximum articulation over uneven terrain, up to 35-inch tires, front and rear mechanical lockers and a nearly 3-foot wading depth. Specs are sparse this early in the game, but we're told to expect close to 1,000 pound-feet of torque and a 3.5-second 0-60 mph sprint. The Traveler will be able to trailer over 7,000 pounds while the Terra is said to haul over 10,000 pounds, with both trucks boasting nearly 2,000 pounds of payload. Like many of their electric competitors, the Traveler and Terra both feature large front trunks (or frunks) beneath their hoods. Scout Motors Scout estimates up to 350 miles of range per charge, but that's subject to change closer to launch. The automaker also hasn't specified exact battery capacity at this point. The EVs will be built on an 800-volt electric architecture, which should allow for relatively fast charging at a capable DC charger. Scout is adopting the North American Charging System at inception, so both EVs will have the Tesla-pioneered NACS port. Bidirectional charging will also be supported at launch along with vehicle-to-load power delivery via an assortment of 120-volt and 240-volt external outlets located next to the slim NACS plug or in the pickup's bed. The rugged utility vehicles will be built at Scout Motors' new $2 billion Blythewood, South Carolina, factory, which broke ground earlier this year. With an estimated capacity of around 200,000 vehicles annually, the factory is expected to begin pumping out the EVs in 2027. The Traveler and the Terra are projected to start ""below $60,000,"" and Scout reckons that price could get as low as $50,000 with incentives. (If there are still incentives to be had two years from now.) Behind the swinging spare tire, the Traveler's split tailgate opens wide to accept cargo. Scout Motors The automaker's ""one more thing"" at the end of the Traveler and Terra debut was a preview of Harvester variants of both models. This extended range electric vehicle (EREV) configuration adds a gasoline-powered range extender/generator to the mix, allowing drivers to continue adventuring far off the electric grid. That sounds a lot like a series plug-in hybrid to me, but Scout emphasizes that the combustion engine has no mechanical connection to the drive wheels -- the battery and e-motors are always turning the wheels -- so it's still technically an electric vehicle. It's unclear where that ICE will fit in the chassis, though judging by the location of the fuel door in photos, I'd guess it goes in the frunk. The conversion also requires the battery pack to shrink a bit to make room for the gas tank. Even so, Scout estimates a 500-mile range with a full tank and battery. I expect we'll learn more in the coming months. The original International Scout's competition included vehicles like Jeep's CJ Wrangler 4x4 and the Ford Bronco. Today, the Wrangler 4xe has been the best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle in America for three years running, and the Bronco returned to the market in 2021 with a wide range of rugged configurations and imposing names like Raptor and Sasquatch. The combustion-powered competition is joined by electric competition from General Motors, Tesla and, of course, Rivian. Scout's initial lineup of vehicles and the company's mission somewhat mirror that of another young American electric startup: Rivian. Scout Motors Rivian is an interesting analog to Scout's rebirth in the US. Both are new American brands that exclusively offer electric trucks and EV SUVs. Earlier this year, the Volkswagen Group and Rivian Motors inked a $5 billion investment and technology sharing partnership, so the connection between the brands may end up being more than that of fierce rivals. The specifics of how that partnership will work and how -- if at all -- Scout Motors will benefit have yet to be fleshed out. However, Scout’s mention of a new “modern zonal architecture,” over-the-air updates and remote diagnostic capabilities -- technologies pioneered in Rivan's recently updated R1 platform -- suggests the partnership may already be bearing fruit.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides a detailed and well-rounded overview of Scout Motors' upcoming electric vehicles, the Traveler SUV, and Terra pickup truck.

(ticker: TSLA). Recently, after a demonstration of Tesla's upcoming capabilities, CEO Elon Musk made bold promises about the future of autonomous vehicles. Notably, he unveiled plans for the ""Cybercab,"" a fully autonomous taxi priced under $30,000 and set for production by 2026, alongside a 20-passenger robovan designed to transform urban mobility. Following these announcements and strong third-quarter earnings that beat expectations on earnings per share and gross margins, Tesla's stock surged 22%, reaching new highs for the year. Musk also teased plans for a lower-cost EV set to enter production in 2025. However, it's not just Tesla that is making waves. ""The EV industry in China continues to experience significant growth, with new EV sales surpassing 50% of total car sales for three consecutive months,"" says Anthony Sassine, senior investment strategist and head of Middle East and North Africa at KraneShares, an asset management firm. Sassine highlights that notable Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD Company Ltd. (OTC: BYDDF), Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd. (ZK) and Li Auto Inc. (LI) are leading the charge, with Nio Inc. (NIO) and XPeng Inc. (XPEV) also showing robust sales figures. ""Tesla has recently regained ground in China, but we believe its growth may still be hindered by a lack of new, lower-priced models,"" Sassine argues. For example, the current base model 2025 Tesla Model 3 starts at $44,130, while the BYD Han EV is priced at 229,800 Chinese yuan, or around $36,500. This competitive pressure underscores the importance of considering broader exposure to the EV market, including key players in China that could show up on American streets in the future. ""Looking ahead, we expect the EV industry to enter a second wave of growth, one that could surpass the first as mass adoption accelerates and EV infrastructure continues to expand globally,"" Sassine says. For investors looking to capitalize on the diverse opportunities within the global EV sector, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can offer a strategic tool. ""The EV ecosystem tends to be broad and includes many industries, so owning the entire basket rather than owning one or two companies alone tends to better diversify risks and provides a more balanced approach,"" Sassine says. Whether you're bullish on Tesla or looking to hedge with investments in its competitors, EV ETFs can offer a convenient and effective way to invest in the future of transportation. Here are seven of the best EV ETFs to buy today: ETF Expense ratio Average annual total return since inception KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF (KARS) 0.72% 5.6% iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (IDRV) 0.47% 6.0% Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) 0.68% 8.6% SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL) 0.45% 1.2% Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) 0.75% 3.9% Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) 0.59% -43.9% Invesco Electric Vehicle Metals Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (EVMT) 0.59% -19.8% KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF (KARS) ""While increased competition has pressured margins for some EV manufacturers and suppliers, it has also pushed the industry to find ways to lower EV prices,"" Sassine says. ""In response, luxury EV brands like Li Auto and Nio have introduced more affordable EV models, while others have reduced prices on existing models, bringing the industry closer to ICE parity."" For EVs, KraneShares offers KARS. This ETF tracks the Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Index, which encompasses the complete EV supply chain, including raw material production, manufacturing, sales and charging infrastructure. Thanks to KraneShares' Chinese market expertise, this ETF holds many hard-to-access ""A-Shares"" companies listed on mainland Chinese stock exchanges. The ETF charges a 0.72% expense ratio. iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (IDRV) ""We believe that EV adoption will still outpace traditional automotive sales growth over the long term due to increased efficiency in driving range, energy consumption and charging times, ultimately leading to lower operating cost and higher adoption,"" says Robert F. Draper Jr., founder and chief investment officer at Draper Asset Management. Another ETF investors can use for EV exposure is IDRV. This ETF tracks the NYSEA FactSet Global Autonomous Driving and Electric Vehicle Index, a globally diversified benchmark holding 49 companies. Top holdings currently include Tesla, Li Auto, XPeng, BYD and Nio. It is heavily weighted to the consumer discretionary sector and both the U.S. and Chinese EV industries at 30% and 26%, respectively. IDRV charges a 0.47% expense ratio. Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) ""It is our opinion that the major U.S. automotive manufacturers, commonly referred to as the 'Big Three,' have largely relinquished the pure EV market to Tesla and Chinese counterparts, most notably BYD,"" Draper notes. This trio includes General Motors Co. (GM), Ford Motor Co. (F) and Stellantis NV (STLA). While these manufacturers have long dominated the ICE industry, their EV efforts have largely faltered. Still, investors may still want to include these giants in the event that either EV market penetration slows, or their management executes a successful pivot later. For this role, consider DRIV, which owns the usual EV companies but also includes ICE manufacturers like General Motors, Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (HMC). DRIV charges a 0.68% expense ratio. SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF (HAIL) HAIL is less of a pure EV play than a bet on the future of transportation. This ETF tracks the S&P Kensho Smart Transportation Index, which holds EV industry stocks but also owns companies that manufacture drones, autonomous vehicles, transportation tracking and Internet of Things technology for vehicles. It charges a 0.45% expense ratio and has around $27 million in assets under management. HAIL's benchmark is a composite, blending the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index, the S&P Kensho Autonomous Vehicles Index, the S&P Kensho Advanced Transport Systems Index and the S&P Kensho Drones Index. The end result is a portfolio of 71 companies, with 23% belonging to automotive manufacturing and another 16% comprising automotive parts and manufacturing. Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) The EV supply chain doesn't start with manufacturers. Arguably, it begins when the critical materials for batteries are mined, notably lithium. Lithium is a crucial component in the production of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which power the majority of commercially available EVs today. For exposure to the lithium ecosystem, Global X ETFs offers LIT at a 0.75% expense ratio. LIT tracks the Solactive Global Lithium Index, which retains some exposure to notable EV manufacturers like Tesla and BYD. However, the ETF is largely dominated by materials sector companies due to its focus on miners. Notably, the top holding in LIT is Albemarle Corp. (ALB), a leading producer of lithium and a large supplier for global EV manufacturers. LIT currently has just over $1.3 billion in assets. Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) ""BATT offers investors an affordable entry into the fast-growing lithium and battery technology market, providing global exposure to the full battery ecosystem from raw materials to EV and energy storage manufacturers as well as charging infrastructure companies,"" says Christian Magoon, founder and CEO of Amplify ETFs. The ETF charges a 0.59% expense ratio, lower than competitor LIT. This ETF tracks the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology Index. In terms of top holdings, BATT owns both BYD and Tesla, and also BHP Group Ltd. (BHP), a notable large-cap Australian-based lithium miner. ""Since BATT's launch in 2018, we've seen additional demand drivers emerge for these metals from mobile technology and the need for large-scale energy storage,"" Magoon explains. Invesco Electric Vehicle Metals Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (EVMT) According to asset management firm Invesco, rather than betting on EV companies, which may or may not survive given increased competition, holding direct exposure to the actual metals used in EV manufacturing may be a more efficient approach. For this role, Invesco offers EVMT, a unique ETF that tracks the S&P GSCI Electric Vehicle Metals Index for a 0.59% expense ratio.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article titled ""7 Best Electric Vehicle ETFs to Buy"" primarily focuses on providing investment insights into the electric vehicle (EV) industry rather than offering original insights or analysis on electric vehicles themselves.

Sure, past campaigns have made glancing reference to the storied auto sector, mostly as a stand-in for popular tropes like American ingenuity and hard work. But this election feels different. The combination of Michigan, the home of the Big Three automakers (Ford, GM, and Stellantis), as a crucial swing state and the historic shift toward electric vehicles, has put the industry in the red-hot center of an already unpredictable presidential race. Naturally, this all got distilled and distorted through the right-wing media woodchipper as a government mandate to purchase electric vehicles and a ban on our beloved gas cars. Former President Donald Trump and the Republican apparatus seized on what they saw as trepidation among consumers about EV range and high prices and turned that into a message of government overreach. After all, EVs could be cold and digital, while the pistons firing under the hoods of gas cars had all the patriotic fervor of a firework display. Trump spent most of the year ridiculing EVs on the campaign trail, claiming they would “kill” the American auto industry and “assassinate” jobs. The United Auto Workers strike over the summer added fuel to the fire, with many workers expressing unease about the shift. Trump declared that the Biden administration “ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing” by encouraging the sale of electric cars. (Language that now seems weirdly prescient given the multiple recent attempts on his life.) And he’s promised to reverse Biden’s policies on “day one” if elected in November. To be sure, the Democrats’ plan was a familiar neoliberal mash-up of tax credits and abatements aimed at getting people who are already well off to spend a little more on an expensive EV in the hopes that sales volume would eventually help cool prices. Republicans could have had a reasonable counter message about excessive spending to help the rich better afford cool cars but instead ended up settling on Trump’s fever dream distortions. The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise The swift politicization of EVs took many by surprise, including the people in charge of making them: “I never thought the propulsion system on a vehicle would be [political],” General Motors CEO Mary Barra recently told CBS News Sunday Morning. Ford CEO Jim Farley penned a LinkedIn post about how much he loves EVs and his belief that they should have “nothing to do with politics.” Of course, it’s naive to think that anything that happens in America in the 21st century can be completely divorced from politics. The type of car you buy has always been a signifier of certain core beliefs. Pickup trucks are Republican-coded, much in the same way the Toyota Prius is often associated with coastal liberals. Politics has always been ingrained in the car business. The federal government regulates safety, while drivers are licensed by states. But more than that, the government uses its policy-making powers to steer consumers to certain desired outcomes, just as regulations force manufacturers to adopt preferred technologies. And these policies originate from certain beliefs, such as the certainty that climate change is a very real threat and tailpipe pollution is a major contributor. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted new rules aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2032. EVs would need to account for over half of new vehicle sales for automakers to meet these strict mandates. Trump claims to believe that people should have the freedom to drive whatever car they want, regardless of the environmental impact. To him, rising sea levels imply more desirable “oceanfront property.” But beliefs are malleable, and politics is fickle. Tesla owners who thought they were making an environmentally conscious choice are now stuck driving totems to Elon Musk’s quixotic turn to the right. And the Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs. No longer are they stealthy job assassins — now, Trump lauds them as “incredible,” if not for everyone. The Tesla CEO’s slavish support for Trump has helped to soften the former president’s stance on EVs Polls show that support for EVs splits along party lines. Democrats continue to funnel billions into EV infrastructure, even as sales growth slows and manufacturers suddenly balk at the aggressive stance they themselves took when EVs seemed poised to take over the world. Plug-in hybrids are now the new fad. Trump says that, if elected, no state would be allowed to ban internal combustion engines. Out on the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris has kept EVs — and indeed the entire Biden climate legacy — at an arm’s length, instead talking about her support for fracking as she attempts to court the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Her shift to the center has left EVs in a bit of a chilly spot. Harris has been tough to pin down on EVs. She knows that Biden’s embrace didn’t quite pay off for him politically. EVs poll poorly in battleground states, including Michigan. And now that Trump has Musk giddily hopping around onstage for him like a marionette, Trump’s free to ramp up his attacks, pouring money into ads that falsely claim that Harris wants to “end all gas cars.” After weeks of dodging the issue, Harris addressed it head-on in a speech in Flint, Michigan: “Let us be clear,” she said, “contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.” Only 3 in 10 Americans said they would consider an EV for their next purchase, and support is dropping, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew cites a familiar set of concerns around charging, range anxiety, and prices. Another recent study says the number of Americans that actually believe EVs are better for the planet than gas-powered cars is also dropping. The US has spent billions of dollars to push EVs, and the needle is barely moving. In May 2024, EVs represented 6.8 percent of overall car sales in the US, down from 8.8 percent of total sales in 2023. With growth flatlining, Biden’s emphasis on EVs as the key weapon against climate change is looking misplaced, especially when compared to the multi-decade investments that paved the way for China to claim the EV crown. China has cracked the code on cheap EVs, with several models selling for $20,000 or less. The only country producing EVs is our enemy in a new cold war In the US, the average EV transaction is still north of $50,000. If Chinese EV makers like Geely and BYD are allowed to sell them in the US, industry soothsayers warn it could usher in the end of the Big Three. It’s a paradox: we need EVs to reduce emissions, and they need to be cheap so people can buy them, but the only country producing them is our enemy in a new cold war. Neither Harris nor Trump seems to have much in the way of solutions to China except more tariffs and more protectionist trade policies. Americans need cheap EVs, and China has plenty to sell. But if there’s anything that Trump, Biden, and Harris can all agree on, it’s that you will never be allowed to buy one. Weirdly, EVs have sucked up so much airtime, we really have no clue about either candidate’s position on the rest of transportation. If you search their policy platforms online, you won’t find any mention of important issues like infrastructure, aviation, public transit, or urban planning. But since the past is prologue, we can make some educated guesses. Harris likely supports the Biden administration’s efforts to clean up the transportation network by investing in electrification, while also focusing on walkable cities and environmental justice initiatives. Meanwhile, Trump seems poised to eliminate funding for public transportation and would continue funding highway expansion projects, as outlined in the notorious Project 2025 document. But until we know the result of the election, we won’t know for sure.",Politics,bing,"The article provides an in-depth analysis of the role of electric vehicles (EVs) in the political landscape, particularly focusing on the upcoming presidential election.

The EU Is Imposing Duties on Electric Vehicles From China After Trade Talks Fail,The EU Is Imposing Duties on Electric Vehicles From China After Trade Talks Fail BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is imposing duties on imports of electric vehicles from China starting ...,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-10-29/the-eu-will-impose-duties-on-electric-vehicle-imports-from-china-from-thursday,,2024-10-29 12:11:00,U.S. News & World Report,,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is imposing duties on imports of electric vehicles from China starting Wednesday after talks between Brussels and Beijing failed to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. “By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. “In parallel, we remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and (World Trade Organization)-compatible,” he added. The duties would stay in force for five years, unless an amicable solution is found. According to the commission, which manages trade disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, sales of Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties on Chinese manufacturers will be 17% on cars made by BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an “individually calculated” rate for Tesla of 7.8%. China’s Commerce Ministry objected to the measures as protectionist and unfair. “China does not agree with it and will not accept the ruling” the ministry's statement said. “China will continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.” The EU’s retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers. The head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the imposition of the tariffs is “a setback for free global trade and so for prosperity, the preservation of jobs and Europe’s growth.” Hildegard Müller said the move increases the risk of a far-reaching trade conflict. “The industry is not naive in dealing with China, but the challenges must be resolved in dialogue,” Müller said in a statement. The measures were published in the bloc's legal Official Journal late Tuesday, meaning duties enter into force as of midnight, said EU spokeswoman Arianna Podesta. The commission says China boosted its EU market share with the help of subsidies across the production chain. These ranged from cheap land for factories provided by local governments, to cut-price supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises, to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in China's market share has sparked concern in the EU that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU’s ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change. Business groups and unions also fear that the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers could be put in jeopardy, as well those of 10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly on EV production. ___ Associated Press journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.

Although both the recently unveiled Terra Truck and Traveler SUV still fall under the banner of “production-intent concepts”, they give us our best look yet at what Volkswagen is trying to achieve by reviving the brand. And that clearly means retro looks, nostalgic nods to the past and modern technology that features tactile buttons and mechanical switches where possible. As someone with a mild obsession for old Chevrolet pick-ups from the 1960s and 70s, I think it's wonderful – all of the best bits of classic American trucks, without the worry about things falling off or rusting away in the rain. (Image credit: Scout Motors) Despite previously suggesting that Scout was going to be a pure battery EV manufacturer, it has decided to also offer a range-extending hybrid into the mix, which the company states is good for around 500 miles of total range and should go some way to bash range anxiety over the head. Pure electric versions of the Terra Truck will offer 350 miles, but there’s still no official word on the battery and motors used. However, all-wheel-drive comes as standard (obviously) and the most powerful versions of both Terra and Traveler should be able to hit 60mph from rest in around 3.5 seconds. But it is inside Scout's concepts where the nostalgia really kicks in, because the brand is arguably among the first to revive the front bench seat – a mainstay in the trucks and SUVs of America’s glorious yesteryear.

Analysis: Volkswagen needs a truck-shaped sales boost (Image credit: Scout Motors) Manufacturers clearly deem retro to be en vogue, as it is a mechanism that has recently been employed by French marque Renault, with the launch of its all-electric Renault 5 and upcoming Renault 4 models, while both Mini and Fiat are still playing on their heritage with great success. Scout’s main rival, Rivian, is already notching up solid sales of its second-generation R1T and R1S models, as well as teasing the mid-sized R2 and R3, which are due sometime in 2026. All of these feature a hefty dose of nostalgia in their designs, too. We won’t see either of Scout’s models hit the road until at least 2027, when the company predicts they will be on sale for $50,000 (around £38,000 / AU$75,600) to $60,000 (around £46,000 / AU$91,000) with incentives. This is all subject to market conditions at the time of launch, of course, but pricing appears competitive, considering a Rivian R1T costs almost $10,000 more, while a base Cybertruck now hovers at $74,490. Interestingly, Scout has also said it is going to eschew Volkswagen's traditional dealer sales channels – much to the dismay of disgruntled dealers. (Image credit: Scout Motors) Instead, it will sell direct to consumer via its own unique spaces, as well as offer the ability to purchase online and through its app. It is a bid to modernize the buying experience and cut out the middleman. It all feels very modern and appealing to the younger buyer, but will nostalgia and direct-to-consumer sales be enough to persuade them to make the switch? Volkswagen could do with a truck-shapes sales boost in the US, as dwindling sales in China are currently stifling its progress in the EV market.

It certainly proved them wrong, and it delivered a record 1.8 million units in 2023 alone. However, sales are clearly slowing. Tesla delivered 1.29 million EVs in the first three quarters of 2024, which represented a drop of 2.3% compared to the same period last year. That means its annual deliveries are on track to shrink for the first time since it launched the flagship Model S in 2011 -- even though the company has drastically slashed prices over the past year to boost demand. Demand is softening across the EV industry right now as consumers opt for cheaper gas-powered cars amid tough economic conditions headlined by high interest rates. Plus, a report by Goldman Sachs suggests consumers are concerned about a lack of rapid charging infrastructure, as well as the declining resale value of EVs in general. But Tesla also faces a growing competitive threat, with low-cost manufacturers like China-based BYD threatening to flood global markets with cheap EVs. BYD's Seagull sells for under $10,000 in China, and it could be on its way to Europe in 2025. Those are important geographic markets for Tesla, and none of its passenger EVs can compete at that price point. Tesla CEO Elon Musk outlined plans to build a low-cost EV, which was expected to go into production in 2025 and sell for $25,000, but during his conference call with investors for the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), he said the project is no longer going ahead. FSD and robotaxis are the way forward, according to Musk Musk says building a low-cost passenger EV is ""pointless"" because Tesla's future is in autonomous vehicles instead. The company unveiled the Cybercab earlier this month, which is a self-driving robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. The Cybercab will run on Tesla's FSD software, which the company has been developing for years. However, it does not have approval for unsupervised use in the U.S. yet, and a human driver must be ready to take over at all times. But based on the data collected from extensive beta testing in its passenger EVs, it is possible that the Cybercab is already safer than the average car on the road. According to Tesla's most recent quarterly vehicle safety report, FSD caused one crash every 7 million miles, compared to one crash every 700,000 miles for the average U.S. driver. In other words, FSD is 10 times safer than human-driven vehicles, statistically speaking, as it stands today. The software will only get better over time because the AI models upon which it is based are constantly learning from new data. Tesla is currently building a cluster of 50,000 graphics processing chips (GPUs) from Nvidia to train FSD further. In fact, the company is on track to spend $11 billion on AI data center infrastructure this year for that very purpose. As a result, Musk expects the software to eventually receive regulatory approval for unsupervised use. He says it could be available in Texas next year, and potentially California. FSD could transform Tesla's economics Tesla expects to monetize FSD in three primary ways: Selling the software to owners of Tesla's passenger EVs. Licensing the software to other car manufacturers for a fee. Through a ride-hailing network Tesla built in-house, which will allow Cybercabs to transport passengers at all hours of the day (like Uber, except completely driverless). Owners of Tesla's passenger EVs will also be able to lend their FSD-enabled cars to the network to earn extra income, which will be split with the company. Plus, the Cybercab will be available for purchase for an expected price of $30,000, so practically anybody can buy a fleet and set up their own driverless ride-hailing network. All of those revenue sources could carry high profit margins. Software companies, for example, often have a gross profit margin of 80% or more, which is far higher than Tesla's current gross margin of 19.8% across its portfolio of hardware businesses today. Plus, Uber paid its drivers a whopping $17.9 billion in the last quarter alone, which was its largest expense by far. That's an indication of how much money Tesla could save with an autonomous ride-hailing network operating at scale. Ark's financial models suggest Tesla will generate $1.2 trillion in annual revenue by 2029, with FSD and Cybercab accounting for 63%. However, thanks to those high profit margins, Ark believes those products will account for 86% of a forecast $440 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Ark's forecast might be ambitious, and Tesla stock isn't cheap right now Wall Street's consensus estimate (according to Yahoo) suggests Tesla is on track to generate $99 billion in total revenue in 2024. That means it will have to grow twelvefold by 2029 -- or by a compound annual rate of 64.7% for the next five years -- to meet Ark's forecast. FSD and the Cybercab will have to scale up rapidly for Tesla to grow at that pace, because $99 billion in revenue this year would represent growth of just 2% compared to 2023. In 2025, Wall Street expects revenue to grow by just 15%. Simply put, passenger EV sales alone won't get the job done. Plus, investors have to pay a hefty price to bet on Tesla's autonomous future, because its stock currently trades at a steep premium to the broader market. Based on its trailing-12-month earnings per share of $3.65, its stock currently sits at a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 68.5. That's more than double the 32.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 technology index. Tesla's future is incredibly exciting, but according to Musk's own forecast, the Cybercab won't go into mass production until 2026. That means the company's fate will rest on passenger EV sales for at least the next year. While Musk thinks they could grow by as much as 30% in 2025, I have doubts, considering the low-cost model is no longer going ahead, which leaves the brand susceptible to competitors like BYD. In summary, Ark might be right about FSD and the Cybercab eventually, but its 2029 target is ambitious. Therefore, it might be best to wait until we receive more information next year before buying Tesla stock. Alternatively, if there is a pullback that brings its P/E ratio in line with the Nasdaq-100, that might be a good opportunity to take a long-term position.",Uncategorized,bing,"The article provides unique insights into Tesla's strategic shift from a focus on electric vehicle (EV) sales to the development of self-driving technology and autonomous vehicles, which is a fresh perspective in the context of Tesla's business model.

The automaker is looking into incorporating more ICE and hybrid options into lineups that were developed as EV-only. New 718 models and the Macan SUV were conceived as EVs, and it may be too late to easily adapt them to combustion power. Porsche is making some radical changes to its electrification strategy in response to slumping Taycan sales and a stubborn loyalty among customers to good old combustion-powered machines. For a brand that up until now seemed all-in on electric, the pivot speaks volumes about Porsche’s read on its buyers’ preferences—and their reluctance to abandon traditional powertrains. The automaker, which has publicly come out against Europe’s proposed 2035 ban on combustion engines, is now investigating how it might re-engineer future cars that were designed as EVs to accept hybrid powerplants. But that’s going to take a herculean effort and ton of cash if it’s even possible. More: Porsche Confirms New 911 Turbo Hybrid Coming Next Year The next-generation 718 Boxster and Cayman sports cars are fully electric, fully signed off and will be launched in the coming months. It’s possible Porsche could reverse-engineer them to accept combustion engines, as Fiat has been forced to do with the 500e. However, even if they greenlighted the idea, it would be years before a retrofitted model hit the road, assuming it’s financially worthwhile at all. Another vehicle that Porsche conceived as an EV, but which must be under consideration for a combustion rethink is the flagship K1 SUV due in 2028. The timeframe and likely dimensions of the three-row K1 suggest it has a better chance of being adapted to hybrid power. Next Cayenne will be available with combustion or electric power Customer Demand Drives Strategy Shift “A lot of customers in the premium and luxury segment are looking in the direction of combustion-engined cars, there’s a clear trend,” Porsche CFO Lutz Meschke said in a conference call before going on to explain how the brand is reacting to that news. “We will refresh our combustion engine cars, including the Panamera and the Cayenne, and of course, we will continue to rely on plug-in hybrids” Meschke added. Flexible Production for a Mixed Lineup “As for our electrified lineup, we are very flexible when it comes to our production footprint. We can produce combustion engine, plug-in hybrids and electrified cars in one production line in Leipzig,” Meschke continued. “When it comes to research and development, you’ll see more flexibility in the upcoming years. We will develop new combustion-engined derivatives [of our EVs] in order to give the right answer to customer demand.” Related: Porsche Taycan Sales Are A Disaster, But Cayenne Saves The Day Porsche had at one time planned for 80 percent of its lineup to be EVs by the end of the decade. The remaining 20 percent would be accounted for by the 911, which has gained its first hybrid model, but was always going to stay away from fully-electric power until well into the 2030s. Porsche enjoyed early success with the Taycan and engineered an electric Macan and the upcoming 718 EVs, with visions of those models taking over from the older ICE equivalent after being offered in tandem during a handover period. Sales Drop Challenges Porsche’s EV Push But Taycan sales have tanked this year despite the introduction of a facelifted model, particularly in the once-lucrative Chinese market, while combustion 718 sales have rallied as buyers get them while they can.

It will marks Lancia’s first exclusively electric model under the Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategy, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2038. By 2028, Lancia’s lineup will be fully electric, starting with the Gamma, and eventually the Delta. Update 10/25: It’s been a full year since we last heard anything official about the upcoming Lancia Gamma, but today Stellantis finally tossed us a teaser. Don’t get too excited, though—the “news” just rehashes what CEO Luca Napolitano already confirmed in 2023. Yes, the mid-sized Gamma will be built on the STLA Medium platform, and yes, production is set to start at Stellantis’ Melfi plant in Italy in 2026. In other words, nothing new here, but we guess Stellantis has to keep the Lancia revival hype on life support somehow. “The new Lancia Gamma represents a milestone in our journey towards the future”, says Luca Napolitano, Lancia CEO, in what’s starting to feel like standard-issue corporate optimism to hide the gloom and doom. “It embodies our brand’s commitment to sustainability and high performance, while celebrating the unmistakable elegance that has defined Lancia for decades. By producing it at the historic Melfi plant, we are strengthening our connection to Italy’s rich automotive heritage and advancing our vision for an electrified future. Gamma will showcase the best of what Lancia stands for: innovation, style, and a relentless pursuit of excellence” Lancia has unveiled its roadmap for the upcoming decade, and it’s no surprise that electrification takes center stage. The journey began with the introduction of the new Ypsilon in 2024, which will be followed by the launch of the flagship Gamma EV in 2026, and culminating with an all-electric Delta in 2028. The Italian brand confirmed that the upcoming Ypsilon will be offered in both pure battery-powered and hybrid variants. However, beginning in 2026, the company will exclusively introduce new EVs, and by 2028, their entire lineup will consist solely of electric-powered models. This implies that the hybrid Ypsilon will have a relatively short lifespan, lasting only four years. In 2026, Lancia is set to debut its first exclusive electric vehicle, to be manufactured at Stellantis’ Melfi plant in Italy. Measuring in at 185 inches (4.7 meters) long, it will be roughly the same size as a BMW 4-series. Lancia’s CEO, Luca Napolitano, says that it will be an elegant fastback that is based on the STLA medium platform. Notably, he had previously confirmed the resurrection of the Gamma nameplate. “Our second flagship car, slated to debut in 2026, will be named ‘Gamma,'” Napolitano affirmed. More: What We Know About The 2028 Lancia Delta Premium Hatch The 2023 Lancia Ypsilon “The flagship of Casa Lancia will be a beautiful and elegant Italian car, beautiful outside and beautiful inside, where it will really look like you feel in the living room of an Italian house,” said Napolitano. “The STLA Medium platform will be perfect for Lancia, as a native BEV will be very efficient and will guarantee high levels of comfort, offering both a front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive version.” Thanks to its platform, Lancia anticipates that the flagship model will get up to 435 miles (700 km) of range per charge. It also expects 50 percent of the EV’s sales to come from European countries outside of Italy. Illustrations Francois Hubert/SB-Medien for CarScoops Unfortunately, few details have been revealed about the new Delta, which is due in 2028, but speaking to Italian media in the past, Luca Napolitano confirmed the return of the compact model saying: “It will return and it will be a true Delta – an exciting car, a manifesto of progress and technology, and obviously it will be electric”.

Scout Motors mounts an electric comeback with new SUV and truck concepts,"The brand went bust in 1980 — but now, it’s back, and it’s all-electric. Scout, which is now an independent company under the Volkswagen Group, introduced its first new-concept vehicles ...",https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24277692/scout-motors-suv-truck-ev-concept-announce-price-specs,,2024-10-24 22:31:00,The Verge,,"Decades ago, Scout Motors helped introduce America to the “sport utility vehicle,” a quirky new automobile that would eventually come to dominate our roads. The brand went bust in 1980 — but now, it’s back, and it’s all-electric. Scout, which is now an independent company under the Volkswagen Group, introduced its first new-concept vehicles today: the Terra truck and the Traveler SUV. Both vehicles are body-on-frame, sitting on top a brand-new EV platform unique to Scout. And both could start at under $60,000 (without incentives) when production begins in 2027. But beyond the novelty of launching a new EV brand when sales are still struggling, and on the eve of a major election that could determine the future of the auto industry, Scout is trying to sell something that no one has really tried before: a genuine throwback that also feels modern and fresh. “It’s sort of this simple concept, but tough to execute,” said Scout CEO Scott Keogh, defining it as “heritage meets ingenuity.” The “Connection Machine” Before we get to the story of Scout’s comeback, let’s run through the specs, because there are some real doozies here: Body-on-frame chassis, solid rear axle, and front and rear mechanical lockers for off-road performance Projected towing of over 7,000 pounds for the Scout Traveler and over 10,000 pounds for the Scout Terra, both with nearly 2,000 pounds of payload Estimated zero to 60mph acceleration in 3.5 seconds, made possible by an estimated 1,000 pound-feet of torque through the four-wheel-drive system Vehicle software built upon a modern zonal architecture, enabling over-the-air updates and remote diagnostics Bidirectional charging and vehicle-to-home capabilities One fully electric trim with up to 350 miles of range and an extended range model with more than 500 miles of range through a gas-powered range extender There’s a lot more, including a removable cabana roof, optional bench seats in both the front and rear, and a lot of tactile touchpoints, like mechanical door handles, grab bars, and big, chunky dials and switches. Bench seats! Image: Scout Motors When I first spoke to Keogh earlier this year, he told me he didn’t want to make another hyperminimalist EV, festooned with touchscreens, glassy surfaces, and haptic buttons. He wanted to make something that was real and mechanical — something that you could grab and feel connected to. “There’s definitely a large segment that wants to bring forth some of the heritage thing,” he said this week. “They don’t want to be isolated from the car... They want to have real switches. They want to have mechanical touch and feel.” Keogh says the company is calling it the “Connection Machine” — a phrase it appears to be trying to trademark. The idea is that when you’re behind the wheel, tearing through some gravel or ripping up a 100 percent grade, you’re connected to the car through the physical act of driving but also your passengers, bumping up against each other on the same bench seat. Previous Next 1 / 9 Previous Next 1 / 9 In the zone That said, there are plenty of design and engineering choices that prove that Scout has its sights set firmly on the horizon. The inclusion of a zonal architecture, rather than a domain-style electrical setup, will help ensure that the vehicles have a lot of “headroom” for future updates, Keogh said, reducing costs not only on the manufacturing side but also for owners through reduced maintenance costs. Zonal architecture is still relatively niche in the auto industry. Tesla has been doing it for years, but most automakers use domain architectures, with dozens of electronic control units that control everything from power windows and airbags to braking. Rivian recently switched to a zonal system when it launched the next-gen versions of its R1 vehicles. And VW (which owns Scout) made a big deal of licensing Rivian’s “zonal hardware design” when it announced its plan to invest $5 billion in the EV company. Scout had the benefit of starting with a “clean sheet,” Keogh told me. “All these things sound quite minor but setting up your IT architecture without a legacy system — this is huge.” Platform politics Another thing that caught my attention was the news that the Terra and Traveler would be built on “an all-new and proprietary body-on-frame platform.” The fact that Scout would develop its own platform, rather than borrow VW’s modular “MEB” electric vehicle platform, might strike some as strange considering how expensive and labor-intensive it is for a brand-new company to develop its own bespoke platform. Sharing platforms is very common, especially when trying to spin up an entirely new production line. (For example, the Audi RS E-tron GT is built on the same platform as the Porsche Taycan.) “They want to have mechanical touch and feel” To be sure, VW has been going through its own struggles around EVs. The company’s plug-in models are selling well, but its market share in North America is shrinking. And its software has been plagued by bugs and customer complaints. But Keogh assured me that Scout wasn’t trying to ignore its advantages over some of its rivals. The company wants to maintain its individuality but will still share some components with its parent company, like drive units and other modules. Considering VW has never before competed in the off-road segment, Scout will take those components and piece them together into something that can tackle the roughest conditions. “The last thing we want to do is to grab a 100 percent carryover platform with all the modules,” Keogh said, “because then we’d be a badge. And Scout won’t work as a badge at all.” Range life The inclusion of a gas-powered range extender is also sure to raise some eyebrows. At a time when car buyers are flocking to hybrids, Scout certainly could have gone that route and no one would have complained. Instead, the company opted to include a small gas-powered generator that charges the battery, rather than powering the engine. The reason for this was twofold. First, electric trucks have historically struggled with range when carrying heavy payloads or towing large objects. Scout needs to convince truck shoppers that they can do all the truck stuff they love without sacrificing range. The other reason is that Keogh firmly believes that EVs are the future, and he wanted a vehicle that put battery power first, while still offering a smidge of fossil fuels to help quell range anxiety. “It introduces the buyer to electrification on their American terms,” he said. Not dystopian The look of the Terra and Traveler will be immediately recognizable to a lot of people. It successfully blends designs from Ram, Jeep, Range Rover, and Rivian (Scout’s chief designer hails from Stellantis and BMW), while also keeping the same iconic look and feel of the original International Harvester Scouts from the 1960s and ’70s. Keogh said the goal was to land somewhere between avant-garde and safe. In other words, not too dystopian, like the Tesla Cybertruck, but not overly familiar, like the Ford F-150 Lightning. “I think it’s got its own stance and its own world,” he said. “But of course, if you see little glimpses of Range Rover, little glimpses of Rivian, little glimpses of Ram, and a little bit of Scout, okay that sounds cool to me.”",ScienceAndTechnology,bing,"The article offers a detailed and unique analysis of Scout Motors' reemergence into the electric vehicle market with its new SUV and truck concepts.
